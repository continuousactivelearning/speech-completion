200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:42,1:16,mathematical logic today and we begin with propositional calculus propositional calculus is also called propositional calculus is also called propositional logic sentential logic zerothorder logic as opposed to zerothorder logic as opposed to firstorder logic which is a richer firstorder logic which is a richer firstorder logic which is a richer logic and we shall study later in
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:16,1:30,logic and we shall study later in logic and we shall study later in propositional calculus we deal with propositional calculus we deal with propositional calculus we deal with propositions these propositions take on propositions these propositions take on propositions these propositions take on truth values the only semantic entities
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:30,1:43,truth values the only semantic entities truth values the only semantic entities that we deal in propositional calculus that we deal in propositional calculus that we deal in propositional calculus are truth values the truth values could are truth values the truth values could are truth values the truth values could be or or true or false corresponds
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:43,2:05,be or or true or false corresponds be or or true or false corresponds to false and corresponds to there to false and corresponds to there to false and corresponds to there are only two twos are only two twos are only two twos there is no third truth value
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:05,2:21,music music propositions take on truth values as i propositions take on truth values as i propositions take on truth values as i mentioned there are what are called mentioned there are what are called mentioned there are what are called atomic propositions for these atomic atomic propositions for these atomic
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:21,2:37,atomic propositions for these atomic propositions the truth values are given that is we do not analyze these atomic that is we do not analyze these atomic propositions to find out how they became propositions to find out how they became propositions to find out how they became true or false we just know that they are
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:37,2:44,true or false we just know that they are true or false we just know that they are true or false and then we can combine true or false and then we can combine true or false and then we can combine atomic propositions to form what are atomic propositions to form what are
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:44,2:59,atomic propositions to form what are called composite propositions composite called composite propositions composite called composite propositions composite propositions are made using atomic propositions are made using atomic propositions are made using atomic propositions and these atomic propositions and these atomic propositions and these atomic propositions are combined using logical
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:59,3:18,propositions are combined using logical propositions are combined using logical connectives that is composite connectives that is composite connectives that is composite propositions are synthesized from atomic propositions are synthesized from atomic propositions are synthesized from atomic propositions using logical connectives propositions using logical connectives propositions using logical connectives we can compute the truth values of
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:18,3:34,we can compute the truth values of we can compute the truth values of composite propositions using the truth values of its using the truth values of its constituents and also the properties of constituents and also the properties of constituents and also the properties of logical connectives this essentially
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:34,3:58,logical connectives this essentially logical connectives this essentially gives us an algebra of truth values music music algebra of and this algebra is algebra of and this algebra is algebra of and this algebra is called called called boolean algebra after mathematician boolean algebra after mathematician boolean algebra after mathematician george boole so let us begin with a
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:58,4:05,george boole so let us begin with a george boole so let us begin with a study of this algebra boolean algebra study of this algebra boolean algebra study of this algebra boolean algebra which is the underlying algebra of which is the underlying algebra of which is the underlying algebra of propositional calculus so in boolean
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:05,4:23,propositional calculus so in boolean propositional calculus so in boolean algebra we have what are called boolean algebra we have what are called boolean algebra we have what are called boolean functions a boolean function has a functions a boolean function has a functions a boolean function has a signature of this form a boolean
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:23,4:34,signature of this form a boolean signature of this form a boolean function is a mapping from to truth function is a mapping from to truth function is a mapping from to truth values so a boolean function with n values so a boolean function with n values so a boolean function with n inputs an invariable boolean function
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:34,4:48,inputs an invariable boolean function inputs an invariable boolean function takes n truth values as inputs and takes n truth values as inputs and takes n truth values as inputs and produces one truth value as the output so let us consider truth values of so let us consider truth values of boolean functions for various values of
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:48,4:58,boolean functions for various values of boolean functions for various values of n when n equal to that means when n when n equal to that means when n when n equal to that means when there is no input there are two boolean there is no input there are two boolean
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:58,5:09,there is no input there are two boolean functions one is the constant boolean functions one is the constant boolean functions one is the constant boolean function true which always produces one function true which always produces one function true which always produces one and then the constant boolean function f
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:09,5:20,and then the constant boolean function f and then the constant boolean function f which always produces so these are the which always produces so these are the which always produces so these are the variable boolean functions when we variable boolean functions when we variable boolean functions when we consider one variable boolean functions
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:20,5:37,we are considering functions that take we are considering functions that take one boolean value as input and produce one boolean value as input and produce one boolean value as input and produce one boolean value as output functions of one boolean value as output functions of one boolean value as output functions of this signature
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:37,5:49,this signature this signature such a function can be specified using such a function can be specified using such a function can be specified using what is called a tooth table in a truth what is called a tooth table in a truth what is called a tooth table in a truth table we list the inputs so in this case
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:49,5:57,table we list the inputs so in this case table we list the inputs so in this case there is only one input and specify the there is only one input and specify the there is only one input and specify the possible outputs so input here could be possible outputs so input here could be
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:57,6:08,possible outputs so input here could be either or if the input is what either or if the input is what either or if the input is what would the output be if the input is would the output be if the input is would the output be if the input is what is going to be the output once you
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,6:08,6:14,what is going to be the output once you what is going to be the output once you specify these we have the two table for specify these we have the two table for specify these we have the two table for function f now how many such functions function f now how many such functions
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,6:14,6:25,function f now how many such functions could be there depending on how you could be there depending on how you could be there depending on how you choose f of and f of we will have choose f of and f of we will have choose f of and f of we will have different boolean functions which means
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,6:25,6:29,different boolean functions which means different boolean functions which means there are two choices to be made one there are two choices to be made one there are two choices to be made one choice for f of amp toys for f of choice for f of amp toys for f of
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,6:29,6:38,choice for f of amp toys for f of each choice is going to be a boolean each choice is going to be a boolean each choice is going to be a boolean value so there are going to be such value so there are going to be such value so there are going to be such possible choices so let us enumerate all
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,6:38,6:49,possible choices so let us enumerate all possible choices so let us enumerate all such boolean functions when input x is such boolean functions when input x is such boolean functions when input x is or the output could be both zeros we or the output could be both zeros we
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,6:49,6:55,or the output could be both zeros we are choosing for both f of and f of are choosing for both f of and f of are choosing for both f of and f of or we could choose for f of and or we could choose for f of and
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,6:55,7:02,or we could choose for f of and for f of or we could choose for f of for f of or we could choose for f of for f of or we could choose for f of and for f f or we could choose and for f f or we could choose
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,7:02,7:11,and for f f or we could choose for both so these are the four possible for both so these are the four possible for both so these are the four possible choices for f of and f of each choices for f of and f of each choices for f of and f of each choice will define one boolean function
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,7:11,7:27,choice will define one boolean function choice will define one boolean function so we have for one variable boolean so we have for one variable boolean so we have for one variable boolean functions functions functions music now let us name these functions in now let us name these functions in particular let us look at the first
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,7:27,7:36,particular let us look at the first particular let us look at the first column in the first column both the column in the first column both the column in the first column both the function values are therefore let me function values are therefore let me function values are therefore let me call this the zero function the function
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,7:36,7:45,call this the zero function the function call this the zero function the function which produces zero irrespective of the which produces zero irrespective of the which produces zero irrespective of the input value similarly look at the last input value similarly look at the last input value similarly look at the last column here f of is and f of is
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,7:45,7:53,column here f of is and f of is column here f of is and f of is also so this is a function which also so this is a function which also so this is a function which produces irrespective of the input produces irrespective of the input produces irrespective of the input value so let me call this function now
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,7:53,7:59,value so let me call this function now value so let me call this function now the first column these are the th and the first column these are the th and the first column these are the th and the third column respectively so let me the third column respectively so let me
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,7:59,8:08,the third column respectively so let me consider this first column now which consider this first column now which consider this first column now which corresponds to output values and so corresponds to output values and so corresponds to output values and so when you observe that these reproduce when you observe that these reproduce
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,8:08,8:20,when you observe that these reproduce the input we realize that this function the input we realize that this function the input we realize that this function is nothing but x so this is the identity is nothing but x so this is the identity is nothing but x so this is the identity function f of x equals x the first
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,8:20,8:28,function f of x equals x the first function f of x equals x the first column corresponds to the identity column corresponds to the identity column corresponds to the identity function so let me call it x it function so let me call it x it function so let me call it x it reproduces x when you look at the second
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,8:28,8:35,reproduces x when you look at the second reproduces x when you look at the second column you find that it complements x column you find that it complements x column you find that it complements x when x is it produces and when x is when x is it produces and when x is
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,8:35,8:52,when x is it produces and when x is it produces so this is the it produces so this is the it produces so this is the complement of x this we call x bar the complement of x this we call x bar the complement of x this we call x bar the negation of its negation of x
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,8:52,9:01,in words the truth value when x is two in words the truth value when x is two it produces false and when x is false it it produces false and when x is false it it produces false and when x is false it produces two negation of xs denoted
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,9:01,9:15,produces two negation of xs denoted produces two negation of xs denoted variously in these ways so we will use variously in these ways so we will use variously in these ways so we will use all these notations interchangeably so all these notations interchangeably so all these notations interchangeably so you should remember these notations
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,9:15,9:24,you should remember these notations you should remember these notations negation of x could be represented in negation of x could be represented in negation of x could be represented in any of these ways so we have now seen any of these ways so we have now seen any of these ways so we have now seen for one variable boolean functions now
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,9:24,9:39,for one variable boolean functions now for one variable boolean functions now let us go on to look at two variable let us go on to look at two variable let us go on to look at two variable boolean functions how many two variable boolean functions how many two variable
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,9:39,9:50,boolean functions how many two variable boolean functions could there be let us boolean functions could there be let us boolean functions could there be let us say x and y are the inputs to our two say x and y are the inputs to our two say x and y are the inputs to our two variable boolean functions since there
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,9:50,10:04,variable boolean functions since there variable boolean functions since there are two boolean inputs the possible are two boolean inputs the possible are two boolean inputs the possible inputs are and so these inputs are and so these inputs are and so these four are the form the set of all
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,10:04,10:15,four are the form the set of all four are the form the set of all possible inputs now what could the possible inputs now what could the possible inputs now what could the output be f of x y to specify f of x y output be f of x y to specify f of x y
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,10:15,10:21,output be f of x y to specify f of x y you have to specify a boolean value at you have to specify a boolean value at you have to specify a boolean value at each of these four positions so there each of these four positions so there
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,10:21,10:48,each of these four positions so there are positions to be filled in using are positions to be filled in using are positions to be filled in using amp so there are power which is so there are power which is possibilities let us look at all these possibilities let us look at all these
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,10:48,11:12,possibilities let us look at all these possibilities so enumerate all these possibilities so enumerate all these possibilities so enumerate all these possibilities let us consider all possibilities let us consider all possibilities let us consider all possible inputs and so possible inputs and so possible inputs and so there are vacancies to be filled f of
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,11:12,11:23,there are vacancies to be filled f of there are vacancies to be filled f of x y could be any of these so the x y could be any of these so the x y could be any of these so the first one is and the next one is
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,11:23,11:40,first one is and the next one is first one is and the next one is double third one is double double third one is double double third one is double and the fourth one is double and and the fourth one is double and and the fourth one is double and the next one is then
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,11:40,12:01,the next one is then the next one is then these form one half of the these form one half of the these form one half of the possibilities the remaining possibilities the remaining possibilities the remaining possibilities will complement these then possibilities will complement these then possibilities will complement these then we have triple then we have double
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,12:01,12:35,we have triple then we have double we have triple then we have double double double double so those are the so those are the so those are the possibilities so let me number the possibilities so let me number the possibilities so let me number the columns in this fashion starting from
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,12:35,12:48,columns in this fashion starting from columns in this fashion starting from and going up to there are sixteen and going up to there are sixteen and going up to there are sixteen such columns such columns such columns music music music now let us analyze these columns look at
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,12:48,12:53,now let us analyze these columns look at now let us analyze these columns look at the th column the th column produces a the th column the th column produces a the th column the th column produces a irrespective of the input whatever be irrespective of the input whatever be
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,12:53,13:05,irrespective of the input whatever be the values of x and y the output is the values of x and y the output is the values of x and y the output is therefore we call this the function its mirror image its mirror image this column in column the output
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,13:05,13:15,this column in column the output this column in column the output is irrespective of the input value is irrespective of the input value is irrespective of the input value therefore this function we call now therefore this function we call now therefore this function we call now consider the first column in the first
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,13:15,13:27,consider the first column in the first consider the first column in the first column the output is precisely when column the output is precisely when column the output is precisely when both the inputs are if either x is both the inputs are if either x is both the inputs are if either x is or y is then the output is the

200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,13:38,13:47,so this is called the and function which we denote in this manner the and we denote in this manner the and we denote in this manner the and function this is one way of denoting an function this is one way of denoting an function this is one way of denoting an and function its complement is column
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,13:47,13:58,and function its complement is column and function its complement is column in column the output is if either x in column the output is if either x in column the output is if either x or y is this is the negation of the or y is this is the negation of the
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,13:58,14:10,or y is this is the negation of the and function therefore we call it nand and function therefore we call it nand and function therefore we call it nand this is called the nand function column this is called the nand function column this is called the nand function column this the and function
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,14:10,14:21,this the and function this the and function now let us look at column in column now let us look at column in column now let us look at column in column the output is precisely when both the the output is precisely when both the the output is precisely when both the inputs are or in other words the
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,14:21,14:30,inputs are or in other words the inputs are or in other words the output is if either x or y is output is if either x or y is output is if either x or y is therefore this we called the or function therefore this we called the or function
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,14:30,14:41,therefore this we called the or function column is the or function the column is the or function the column is the or function the complement of column is column there complement of column is column there complement of column is column there the output is precisely when both the
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,14:41,14:53,the output is precisely when both the the output is precisely when both the inputs are this is called the nor inputs are this is called the nor inputs are this is called the nor function the negation of the or function function the negation of the or function function the negation of the or function which is denoted like this
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,14:53,15:05,now let us come to column six column six now let us come to column six column six is one if either x is or y is but is one if either x is or y is but is one if either x is or y is but not both
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,15:05,15:11,not both not both that is exactly one of x and y should be that is exactly one of x and y should be that is exactly one of x and y should be one for the output to be one this is one for the output to be one this is
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,15:11,15:27,one for the output to be one this is called the xor function denoted in this called the xor function denoted in this called the xor function denoted in this fashion the complement of that is one fashion the complement of that is one fashion the complement of that is one precisely when both the inputs are same
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,15:27,15:32,precisely when both the inputs are same precisely when both the inputs are same that is when both the inputs are the that is when both the inputs are the that is when both the inputs are the output is when both the inputs are output is when both the inputs are
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,15:32,15:41,output is when both the inputs are the output is but when one is and the output is but when one is and the output is but when one is and the other is the output is so this the other is the output is so this the other is the output is so this function is called the equivalent
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,15:41,15:56,function is called the equivalent function is called the equivalent function or the if and only function function or the if and only function function or the if and only function denoted either this way or as an denoted either this way or as an denoted either this way or as an occurrence this is the equivalent
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,15:56,16:15,occurrence this is the equivalent occurrence this is the equivalent function now consider column column function now consider column column function now consider column column is false precisely when x is true but is false precisely when x is true but is false precisely when x is true but y is false this function is called the
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,16:15,16:26,y is false this function is called the y is false this function is called the implication function we say x implies y implication function we say x implies y implication function we say x implies y music music music we will have occasion to talk more about we will have occasion to talk more about
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,16:26,16:36,we will have occasion to talk more about the implication function that is column the implication function that is column the implication function that is column the complement of column is column the complement of column is column the complement of column is column which is the negation of implication
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,16:36,16:44,which is the negation of implication which is the negation of implication which we can denote in this fashion now which we can denote in this fashion now which we can denote in this fashion now let us look at column column is let us look at column column is
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,16:44,16:57,let us look at column column is column reproduces the x column column reproduces the x column column reproduces the x column therefore this is the identity function therefore this is the identity function therefore this is the identity function in x its complement is which is in x its complement is which is
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,16:57,17:13,in x its complement is which is column this is the negation of x now column this is the negation of x now column this is the negation of x now let us look at column which is let us look at column which is let us look at column which is which reproduces input y its complement
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,17:13,17:27,which reproduces input y its complement which reproduces input y its complement is which is column and is which is column and is which is column and therefore it is the negation of y what therefore it is the negation of y what therefore it is the negation of y what remains now column column is
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,17:27,17:35,remains now column column is remains now column column is therefore this is the reverse therefore this is the reverse therefore this is the reverse implication comparing it with column implication comparing it with column implication comparing it with column you find that this is the reverse you find that this is the reverse
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,17:35,17:46,you find that this is the reverse implication if column is a forward implication if column is a forward implication if column is a forward implication x implies y then has to implication x implies y then has to implication x implies y then has to be the reverse implication and then its
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,17:46,17:57,be the reverse implication and then its be the reverse implication and then its complement is the negation of the complement is the negation of the complement is the negation of the reverse implication so now we have named reverse implication so now we have named reverse implication so now we have named all the functions so we find that
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,17:57,18:12,all the functions so we find that all the functions so we find that some of these functions are not some of these functions are not some of these functions are not dependent on both the inputs for example dependent on both the inputs for example dependent on both the inputs for example amp are one variable functions then x
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,18:12,18:20,amp are one variable functions then x amp are one variable functions then x y negation of its negation of y are one y negation of its negation of y are one y negation of its negation of y are one variable function sorry amp are variable function sorry amp are
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,18:20,18:31,variable function sorry amp are variable functions x y x negation of y variable functions x y x negation of y variable functions x y x negation of y are one variable functions the rest are are one variable functions the rest are are one variable functions the rest are two variable functions
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,18:31,18:52,two variable functions two variable functions in general when you have a function of in general when you have a function of in general when you have a function of this form to specify the function you can draw up to specify the function you can draw up what is called the truth table in the
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,18:52,18:59,what is called the truth table in the what is called the truth table in the truth table we list all the inputs to truth table we list all the inputs to truth table we list all the inputs to the function so here there are n inputs the function so here there are n inputs

200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,20:54,21:13,now consider the truth table of a now consider the truth table of a boolean function let us say its a three boolean function let us say its a three boolean function let us say its a three variable boolean function then there are variable boolean function then there are
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,21:13,21:49,variable boolean function then there are eight rows in this truth table these are the eight rows let us say the these are the eight rows let us say the function is specified in this fashion the complement of f also will specify so the complement of f also will specify so a toothed table of a boolean function is
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,21:49,22:02,a toothed table of a boolean function is a toothed table of a boolean function is specified in this fashion so this is a specified in this fashion so this is a specified in this fashion so this is a three variable boolean function three variable boolean function three variable boolean function music
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,22:02,22:29,now let us post this question kandice now let us post this question kandice three variable boolean function be three variable boolean function be three variable boolean function be synthesized using zero one two variable synthesized using zero one two variable synthesized using zero one two variable boolean functions so this is the problem
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,22:29,22:35,boolean functions so this is the problem boolean functions so this is the problem we want to address we are given the we want to address we are given the we want to address we are given the truth table of a function a boolean truth table of a function a boolean
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,22:35,22:41,truth table of a function a boolean function of boolean function can be function of boolean function can be function of boolean function can be completely specified by specifying its completely specified by specifying its completely specified by specifying its truth table because this truth table now truth table because this truth table now
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,22:41,22:49,truth table because this truth table now maps all the possible inputs to the maps all the possible inputs to the maps all the possible inputs to the corresponding outputs so the function is corresponding outputs so the function is corresponding outputs so the function is completely specified by a truth table so
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,22:49,22:53,completely specified by a truth table so completely specified by a truth table so the function is specified using a truth the function is specified using a truth the function is specified using a truth table and we want to see if the function table and we want to see if the function
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,22:53,23:05,table and we want to see if the function can be synthesized using zero one of two can be synthesized using zero one of two can be synthesized using zero one of two variable boolean functions so what will variable boolean functions so what will variable boolean functions so what will come in handy to do this are what are
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,23:05,23:40,come in handy to do this are what are come in handy to do this are what are called de morgans laws we say that even is equivalent to e to we say that even is equivalent to e to if and only if the two tables of even if and only if the two tables of even
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,23:40,23:57,if and only if the two tables of even and e are identical that is they and e are identical that is they and e are identical that is they should have exactly the same behavior in should have exactly the same behavior in should have exactly the same behavior in terms of the output that is when we say
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,23:57,24:04,terms of the output that is when we say terms of the output that is when we say that two expressions even and e are that two expressions even and e are that two expressions even and e are equivalent now de morgans laws specify equivalent now de morgans laws specify
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,24:04,24:16,equivalent now de morgans laws specify certain equivalences it says that for certain equivalences it says that for certain equivalences it says that for two boolean variables x and y x or y by two boolean variables x and y x or y by two boolean variables x and y x or y by the way or can be denoted in either of
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,24:16,24:24,the way or can be denoted in either of the way or can be denoted in either of these two ways and an can be denoted these two ways and an can be denoted these two ways and an can be denoted either as this or a concatenation either as this or a concatenation
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,24:24,24:34,either as this or a concatenation in particular when i write x y i mean x in particular when i write x y i mean x in particular when i write x y i mean x and y so de morgans law the first de and y so de morgans law the first de
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,24:34,24:45,and y so de morgans law the first de morgans law says that the complement of morgans law says that the complement of morgans law says that the complement of x or y is the and of x complement and y x or y is the and of x complement and y
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,24:45,25:00,x or y is the and of x complement and y complement the second de morgans law complement the second de morgans law complement the second de morgans law says that the complement of the and of x says that the complement of the and of x says that the complement of the and of x and y is the or of x complement and y
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,25:00,25:10,and y is the or of x complement and y and y is the or of x complement and y compliment by the way and and is also compliment by the way and and is also compliment by the way and and is also called a conjunction and an order is
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,25:10,25:31,called a conjunction and an order is called a conjunction and an order is also called a disjunction you should be also called a disjunction you should be also called a disjunction you should be familiar with these words so these are the two de morgans laws we so these are the two de morgans laws we say that these two are equivalent the
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,25:31,25:45,say that these two are equivalent the say that these two are equivalent the lefthand side is equivalent to the lefthand side is equivalent to the lefthand side is equivalent to the righthand side but how do we show this righthand side but how do we show this righthand side but how do we show this we can show this using two tables so the
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,25:45,25:50,we can show this using two tables so the we can show this using two tables so the two variable versions of de morgans two variable versions of de morgans two variable versions of de morgans laws can be shown like this take the two laws can be shown like this take the two
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,25:50,26:11,laws can be shown like this take the two inputs x and y and consider all possible inputs x and y and consider all possible inputs x and y and consider all possible inputs and then the inputs and then the inputs and then the complements of x and y would be these
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,26:11,26:22,complements of x and y would be these complements of x and y would be these now let us consider x or y x or y would now let us consider x or y x or y would now let us consider x or y x or y would be these what then would be the
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,26:22,26:33,be these what then would be the be these what then would be the complement of x or y that would be complement of x or y that would be complement of x or y that would be put now de morgans law says that this put now de morgans law says that this
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,26:33,26:46,put now de morgans law says that this is the same as the end of x bar and y is the same as the end of x bar and y is the same as the end of x bar and y bar and is and is and is bar and is and is and is
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,26:46,26:57,bar and is and is and is and and is so you find that and and is so you find that and and is so you find that these two columns correspond exactly to these two columns correspond exactly to these two columns correspond exactly to each other therefore we have x or y the
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,26:57,27:18,each other therefore we have x or y the each other therefore we have x or y the whole bar is equivalent to x bar y bar similarly let us consider x y x y is similarly let us consider x y x y is here amp amp is amp is amp amp
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,27:18,27:31,here amp amp is amp is amp amp here amp amp is amp is amp amp is is is so x y is then what would be x y so x y is then what would be x y so x y is then what would be x y complement that would be amp and
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,27:31,27:39,complement that would be amp and complement that would be amp and what would be x bar or y bar we have x what would be x bar or y bar we have x what would be x bar or y bar we have x bar here and y bar here if you take the
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,27:39,27:45,bar here and y bar here if you take the bar here and y bar here if you take the or of them you get here here here or of them you get here here here or of them you get here here here and here so you find that they again
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,27:45,27:58,and here so you find that they again and here so you find that they again correspond these two columns correspond correspond these two columns correspond correspond these two columns correspond so the complement of x and y is so the complement of x and y is so the complement of x and y is equivalent to the r of x bar and y so
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,27:58,28:07,equivalent to the r of x bar and y so equivalent to the r of x bar and y so this truth table establishes the two de this truth table establishes the two de this truth table establishes the two de morgans laws for two variables in fact morgans laws for two variables in fact
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,28:07,28:17,morgans laws for two variables in fact you can extend this to any number of you can extend this to any number of you can extend this to any number of variables for example if you have variables for example if you have variables for example if you have variables let us say we want to compute
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,28:17,28:24,variables let us say we want to compute variables let us say we want to compute the complement of x or y or z but since the complement of x or y or z but since the complement of x or y or z but since or as an associative operator you can
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,28:24,28:41,or as an associative operator you can or as an associative operator you can write this in this manner then using write this in this manner then using write this in this manner then using demorgans law we can write this as the demorgans law we can write this as the
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,28:41,28:46,demorgans law we can write this as the conjunction of x bar and y plus the conjunction of x bar and y plus the conjunction of x bar and y plus the whole bar but then we know that y plus whole bar but then we know that y plus
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,28:46,28:53,whole bar but then we know that y plus at the whole bar is why was it bound by at the whole bar is why was it bound by at the whole bar is why was it bound by applying de morgans law for two applying de morgans law for two
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,28:53,29:06,applying de morgans law for two variables but since conjunction is variables but since conjunction is variables but since conjunction is associative associative associative we can write this as x bar y bar z bar we can write this as x bar y bar z bar we can write this as x bar y bar z bar in other words the complement of x or y
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,29:06,29:15,in other words the complement of x or y in other words the complement of x or y or z is the conjunction of x bar y bar or z is the conjunction of x bar y bar or z is the conjunction of x bar y bar and z bar similarly
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,29:15,29:36,as a duel we can also find that the as a duel we can also find that the complement of x and y and z is this by complement of x and y and z is this by complement of x and y and z is this by associativity of conjunction but that is
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,29:36,29:54,x bar or y z bar but y zed bar is y bar x bar or y z bar but y zed bar is y bar or z bar which by associativity can be or z bar which by associativity can be or z bar which by associativity can be written in this fashion
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,29:54,30:04,therefore de morgans laws can be therefore de morgans laws can be extended from two variables to three extended from two variables to three extended from two variables to three variables and thus it can also be variables and thus it can also be variables and thus it can also be extended to four variables and so on now
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,30:04,30:30,extended to four variables and so on now extended to four variables and so on now let us go back to our boolean function f and let us say we want to express f in and let us say we want to express f in terms of the inputs x and y
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,30:30,30:51,terms of the inputs x and y terms of the inputs x and y variable logical connectives logical connectives are the same thing logical connectives are the same thing as boolean functions so let us see how f as boolean functions so let us see how f as boolean functions so let us see how f can be expressed in this form for that
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,30:51,30:57,can be expressed in this form for that can be expressed in this form for that let us take another look at the boolean let us take another look at the boolean let us take another look at the boolean the tooth table corresponding to f so the tooth table corresponding to f so
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,30:57,31:17,the tooth table corresponding to f so here here we find that f is precisely here here we find that f is precisely here here we find that f is precisely when xyz are or or when xyz are or or when xyz are or or that is amp which means f is
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,31:17,31:34,that is amp which means f is that is amp which means f is logically equivalent to x bar y z bar logically equivalent to x bar y z bar logically equivalent to x bar y z bar which corresponds to or x y bar which corresponds to or x y bar
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,31:34,31:49,which corresponds to or x y bar z which corresponds to or x y z z which corresponds to or x y z z which corresponds to or x y z which corresponds to when one of which corresponds to when one of which corresponds to when one of these combinations happen then f becomes
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,31:49,31:59,these combinations happen then f becomes these combinations happen then f becomes that is what the truth table tells us that is what the truth table tells us that is what the truth table tells us so f can be expressed as a composite so f can be expressed as a composite
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,31:59,32:13,so f can be expressed as a composite expression of this form this uses the expression of this form this uses the expression of this form this uses the input variables xy and z and logical input variables xy and z and logical input variables xy and z and logical connectives and or and not and this form
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,32:13,32:37,connectives and or and not and this form connectives and or and not and this form is called the sum of products form music music that is because it is expressed as an that is because it is expressed as an that is because it is expressed as an order of several terms or corresponds to
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,32:37,32:51,the addition symbol that is why we call the addition symbol that is why we call it a sum and then each of the terms here it a sum and then each of the terms here it a sum and then each of the terms here is a conjunction for example x bar by z
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,32:51,32:58,is a conjunction for example x bar by z is a conjunction for example x bar by z bar is a conjunction its an end of bar is a conjunction its an end of bar is a conjunction its an end of three literals a literal is either three literals a literal is either
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,32:58,33:07,three literals a literal is either available or its complement so this is a available or its complement so this is a available or its complement so this is a conjunction of several literals conjunction of several literals conjunction of several literals therefore this is called the product therefore this is called the product
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,33:07,33:18,therefore this is called the product form because in arithmetic expressions form because in arithmetic expressions form because in arithmetic expressions juxtaposition corresponds to juxtaposition corresponds to juxtaposition corresponds to multiplication when several entities are multiplication when several entities are multiplication when several entities are juxtaposed we call it a product
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,33:18,33:25,juxtaposed we call it a product juxtaposed we call it a product similarly here also we call this a similarly here also we call this a similarly here also we call this a product so therefore this is a sum of product so therefore this is a sum of product so therefore this is a sum of products form so looking at the truth
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,33:25,33:29,products form so looking at the truth products form so looking at the truth table we can write the sum of products table we can write the sum of products table we can write the sum of products form of the boolean function in this form of the boolean function in this
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,33:29,33:38,form of the boolean function in this manner so this we can extend to any manner so this we can extend to any manner so this we can extend to any truth table given an invariable boolean truth table given an invariable boolean truth table given an invariable boolean functions truth table we can identify
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,33:38,33:46,functions truth table we can identify functions truth table we can identify the rows in which the boolean function the rows in which the boolean function the rows in which the boolean function becomes one then corresponding to these becomes one then corresponding to these becomes one then corresponding to these rows we can form conjunctions like this
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,33:46,33:54,rows we can form conjunctions like this rows we can form conjunctions like this so in this case there are three rows so in this case there are three rows so in this case there are three rows corresponding to and corresponding to and corresponding to and so they can be translated into product
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,33:54,33:59,so they can be translated into product so they can be translated into product forms like this x bar y z bar x y bar z forms like this x bar y z bar x y bar z forms like this x bar y z bar x y bar z x y is it
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,33:59,34:08,x y is it x y is it if either if any one of them is true if either if any one of them is true if either if any one of them is true then the function evaluates to true so then the function evaluates to true so then the function evaluates to true so what we want to say is that the function
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,34:08,34:15,what we want to say is that the function what we want to say is that the function is true if and only if at least one of is true if and only if at least one of is true if and only if at least one of these three terms is true so for any
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,34:15,34:20,these three terms is true so for any these three terms is true so for any boolean assignment at most one of them boolean assignment at most one of them boolean assignment at most one of them will be true so we want to say that f is will be true so we want to say that f is
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,34:20,34:25,will be true so we want to say that f is true if and only if exactly one of them true if and only if exactly one of them true if and only if exactly one of them is true that can be expressed using and is true that can be expressed using and
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,34:25,34:33,is true that can be expressed using and or of all these terms that is why we or of all these terms that is why we or of all these terms that is why we call this a sum of products form call this a sum of products form call this a sum of products form therefore given the truth table of a
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,34:33,34:40,therefore given the truth table of a therefore given the truth table of a boolean function we can write the sum of boolean function we can write the sum of boolean function we can write the sum of products form of the function now let us products form of the function now let us
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,34:40,34:52,products form of the function now let us consider the complement of this function consider the complement of this function consider the complement of this function this complement of the function is in this complement of the function is in this complement of the function is in rows which are not or which means
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,34:52,35:13,rows which are not or which means rows which are not or which means these rows will make the these rows will make the these rows will make the complement of f therefore i can write complement of f therefore i can write complement of f therefore i can write f bar as x bar y bar z bar which
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,35:13,35:26,f bar as x bar y bar z bar which f bar as x bar y bar z bar which corresponds to or x bar y bar z which corresponds to or x bar y bar z which corresponds to or x bar y bar z which corresponds to or x bar y z which
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,35:26,35:38,corresponds to or x bar y z which corresponds to or x bar y z which corresponds to or x y bar z which corresponds to or x y bar z which corresponds to or x y bar z which corresponds to or x y z bar which corresponds to or x y z bar which
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,35:38,35:50,corresponds to or x y z bar which corresponds to so this is the sum of corresponds to so this is the sum of corresponds to so this is the sum of products form for f bar so once you have products form for f bar so once you have
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,35:50,35:59,products form for f bar so once you have the sum of products form for f bar we the sum of products form for f bar we the sum of products form for f bar we can construct an expression for f so an can construct an expression for f so an
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,35:59,36:07,can construct an expression for f so an expression for f can be obtained using expression for f can be obtained using expression for f can be obtained using de morgans law from this sum of de morgans law from this sum of de morgans law from this sum of products form now we want an expression
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,36:07,36:12,products form now we want an expression products form now we want an expression for f which is the complement of f bar f for f which is the complement of f bar f for f which is the complement of f bar f bar is the complement of f and the
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,36:12,36:17,bar is the complement of f and the bar is the complement of f and the complement of that is f so we want to complement of that is f so we want to complement of that is f so we want to compliment the left hand side so we
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,36:17,36:21,compliment the left hand side so we compliment the left hand side so we should compliment the right hand side should compliment the right hand side should compliment the right hand side also so on the right hand side we have a also so on the right hand side we have a
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,36:21,36:30,also so on the right hand side we have a disjunction so when you compliment a disjunction so when you compliment a disjunction so when you compliment a disjunction what you need to do is to disjunction what you need to do is to disjunction what you need to do is to complement each of its terms and then
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,36:30,36:38,complement each of its terms and then complement each of its terms and then take the consumption of these take the consumption of these take the consumption of these complements so we should take the complements so we should take the complements so we should take the compliment of x bar y bar z which is by
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,36:38,36:47,compliment of x bar y bar z which is by compliment of x bar y bar z which is by de morgans law x plus y plus z de morgans law x plus y plus z de morgans law x plus y plus z plus it stands for our that has to be

200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,49:31,49:38,so how would you synthesize nand using h gates alone h gates alone h gates alone that is not possible because if both the that is not possible because if both the that is not possible because if both the inputs are h gates will keep producing inputs are h gates will keep producing
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,49:38,49:48,inputs are h gates will keep producing only zeros it will never produce a so only zeros it will never produce a so only zeros it will never produce a so in and cannot be synthesized using the h in and cannot be synthesized using the h in and cannot be synthesized using the h case therefore we know that h of has
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,49:48,49:55,case therefore we know that h of has case therefore we know that h of has to be similarly we can also argue that to be similarly we can also argue that to be similarly we can also argue that h of has to be that is when both h of has to be that is when both
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,49:55,50:04,h of has to be that is when both the inputs are the output has to be the inputs are the output has to be the inputs are the output has to be otherwise we will not be able to produce otherwise we will not be able to produce otherwise we will not be able to produce for example the or function which
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,50:04,50:16,for example the or function which for example the or function which produces a when both the inputs are produces a when both the inputs are produces a when both the inputs are therefore if you visualize the truth therefore if you visualize the truth therefore if you visualize the truth table of h you find that it should be of
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,50:16,50:25,table of h you find that it should be of table of h you find that it should be of this form the first entry is and the this form the first entry is and the this form the first entry is and the last entry is now there are two

200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,50:35,50:53,ways so let us consider all those ways so let us consider all those possibilities so here we have one and here we have so here we have one and here we have zero then let us fill these vacancies zero then let us fill these vacancies zero then let us fill these vacancies using zero the other alternative
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,50:53,51:18,using zero the other alternative using zero the other alternative sob here or here or here so sob here or here or here so sob here or here or here so these are the possible functions that these are the possible functions that these are the possible functions that could be universal logic gates now what
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,51:18,51:30,could be universal logic gates now what could be universal logic gates now what is is the complement of is is the complement of is is the complement of y and what is it is a complement y and what is it is a complement y and what is it is a complement of x these two cannot be universal
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,51:30,51:36,of x these two cannot be universal of x these two cannot be universal because they depend only on one variable because they depend only on one variable because they depend only on one variable so using these two gates that is the so using these two gates that is the
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,51:36,51:42,so using these two gates that is the negation of y and the negation of x we negation of y and the negation of x we negation of y and the negation of x we will not be able to synthesize any will not be able to synthesize any will not be able to synthesize any boolean function which depends on both
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,51:42,51:53,boolean function which depends on both boolean function which depends on both the inputs so these two are anywhere the inputs so these two are anywhere the inputs so these two are anywhere rolled out what are the remaining this rolled out what are the remaining this rolled out what are the remaining this is nothing but the nor function and this
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,51:53,52:04,is nothing but the nor function and this is nothing but the nor function and this is nothing but the function so we find is nothing but the function so we find is nothing but the function so we find that nor and nand or the only universal that nor and nand or the only universal

201.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,14:47,14:54,rules the presidents rule commonly used rules the presidents rule commonly used are these negation has the highest are these negation has the highest are these negation has the highest precedence which means you have to precedence which means you have to precedence which means you have to associate the negation symbol to the
201.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,14:54,15:12,associate the negation symbol to the associate the negation symbol to the nearest variable first and in nand have nearest variable first and in nand have nearest variable first and in nand have the next perforin s they associate from the next perforin s they associate from the next perforin s they associate from left to right or and nor have the next

201.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,15:27,15:33,but this associates our pool f that our but this associates our pool f that our right to left and double implication has right to left and double implication has right to left and double implication has the least preference which again has a the least preference which again has a
201.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,15:33,15:42,the least preference which again has a right to left association so with these right to left association so with these right to left association so with these presidents in mind let us work out an presidents in mind let us work out an presidents in mind let us work out an example let us see how parentheses can
201.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,15:42,16:08,example let us see how parentheses can example let us see how parentheses can be inserted in this expression first you should insert parentheses here first you should insert parentheses here because an has the highest precedence after that the precedence is or after that the precedence is or therefore you should parenthesize them
201.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,16:08,16:21,therefore you should parenthesize them therefore you should parenthesize them in this manner so this is the first in this manner so this is the first in this manner so this is the first parenthesis this is the second one this parenthesis this is the second one this parenthesis this is the second one this is also at the second level then at the
201.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,16:21,16:31,is also at the second level then at the is also at the second level then at the third level we have implication so this third level we have implication so this third level we have implication so this is the third parent association and then is the third parent association and then
201.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,16:31,16:43,is the third parent association and then the double implication the twoway the double implication the twoway the double implication the twoway implication has the least precedence so implication has the least precedence so implication has the least precedence so this is the last one so this is how you
201.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,16:43,16:50,this is the last one so this is how you this is the last one so this is how you would pattern the size an expression would pattern the size an expression would pattern the size an expression containing many of these connectives let containing many of these connectives let
201.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,16:50,17:03,containing many of these connectives let us consider another expression p implies us consider another expression p implies us consider another expression p implies q implies r when we discuss presidents q implies r when we discuss presidents q implies r when we discuss presidents we said that implications have arrived
201.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,17:03,17:15,we said that implications have arrived we said that implications have arrived to left associativity therefore you will to left associativity therefore you will to left associativity therefore you will have to associate q to r first and then have to associate q to r first and then have to associate q to r first and then an outer parentheses similarly when i
201.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,17:15,17:30,an outer parentheses similarly when i an outer parentheses similarly when i have an expression of this form p or q have an expression of this form p or q have an expression of this form p or q exclusive or r we find that the precedences for this we find that the precedences for this therefore this is where you put the
201.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,17:30,17:38,therefore this is where you put the therefore this is where you put the parentheses first and then the whole of parentheses first and then the whole of parentheses first and then the whole of the expression is put in a parenthesis the expression is put in a parenthesis the expression is put in a parenthesis of a lower students so this is how you
201.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,17:38,18:03,of a lower students so this is how you of a lower students so this is how you would parenthesize boolean expressions would parenthesize boolean expressions would parenthesize boolean expressions an expression is called a tautology if an expression is called a tautology if an expression is called a tautology if its truth table has only ones in the

201.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,18:29,18:48,evaluates to for every assignment to x which means x or x bar is true for every which means x or x bar is true for every which means x or x bar is true for every imaginable assignment if you drop the truth table of it in the if you drop the truth table of it in the rightmost column we have only ones
201.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,18:48,19:03,rightmost column we have only ones rightmost column we have only ones therefore this is a tautology a tautology is a statement which is always tautology is a statement which is always true what will be the truth values that true what will be the truth values that true what will be the truth values that you assigned to the variables of the

201.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,20:52,21:03,and for any assignment p takes on and for any assignment p takes on values and therefore p and here values and therefore p and here values and therefore p and here would be and this seems to be would be and this seems to be would be and this seems to be identical to the first column which is p
201.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,21:03,21:26,identical to the first column which is p identical to the first column which is p so p and is the same as p similarly p or zero you find us p or zero you find us identical to p again proving the identical to p again proving the identical to p again proving the identity loss so when you take the end
201.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,21:26,21:31,identity loss so when you take the end identity loss so when you take the end of p with one you get p itself and if of p with one you get p itself and if of p with one you get p itself and if anything with zero will give you the

202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:21,3:31,predicate of the statement from this predicate of the statement from this statement we can abstract the subject statement we can abstract the subject statement we can abstract the subject away and write in this form i use a away and write in this form i use a away and write in this form i use a variable for the subject and we said
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:31,3:36,variable for the subject and we said variable for the subject and we said that x is greater than three let us say that x is greater than three let us say that x is greater than three let us say we denote this symbolically in this we denote this symbolically in this
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:36,3:50,we denote this symbolically in this manner suppose p of x denotes x greater manner suppose p of x denotes x greater manner suppose p of x denotes x greater than three we might want to abstract than three we might want to abstract than three we might want to abstract away the other constant as well so if
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:50,3:56,away the other constant as well so if away the other constant as well so if you abstract that away then we will you abstract that away then we will you abstract that away then we will have two variables then we will have a have two variables then we will have a
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:56,4:02,have two variables then we will have a sentence of the form x greater than y sentence of the form x greater than y sentence of the form x greater than y where both x and y are unknown we could where both x and y are unknown we could
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:02,4:12,where both x and y are unknown we could denote this as r of x y so now we have denote this as r of x y so now we have denote this as r of x y so now we have two predicates p of x which says that x
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:12,4:17,two predicates p of x which says that x two predicates p of x which says that x greater than and r of x y which greater than and r of x y which greater than and r of x y which greater than which says that x greater greater than which says that x greater
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:17,4:28,greater than which says that x greater than y if you substitute constants for than y if you substitute constants for than y if you substitute constants for the variables in these predicates in the variables in these predicates in the variables in these predicates in this formula by substituting for for x
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:28,4:37,this formula by substituting for for x this formula by substituting for for x we have p which is greater than we have p which is greater than we have p which is greater than this is correct on the other hand if you this is correct on the other hand if you
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:37,4:46,this is correct on the other hand if you substitute for x we have greater substitute for x we have greater substitute for x we have greater than which is false if you substitute than which is false if you substitute than which is false if you substitute for x we have greater than which
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:46,4:52,for x we have greater than which for x we have greater than which is true so depending on the value that is true so depending on the value that is true so depending on the value that you substitute for x here p of x may be you substitute for x here p of x may be
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:52,4:59,you substitute for x here p of x may be true or false true or false true or false similarly in the case of r of x y you similarly in the case of r of x y you similarly in the case of r of x y you can substitute radius values for x and y
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:59,5:09,can substitute radius values for x and y can substitute radius values for x and y you can substitute and which then you can substitute and which then you can substitute and which then would say greater than which is would say greater than which is would say greater than which is false if you substitute and you will
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:09,5:15,false if you substitute and you will false if you substitute and you will have great have great have great than three which is true if you have than three which is true if you have than three which is true if you have seven and four you will have seven
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:15,5:21,seven and four you will have seven seven and four you will have seven greater than three which is true and so greater than three which is true and so greater than three which is true and so on so now we have a way of abstracting on so now we have a way of abstracting
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:21,5:31,on so now we have a way of abstracting individuals away and replacing them with individuals away and replacing them with individuals away and replacing them with variables now let me introduce what are variables now let me introduce what are variables now let me introduce what are called quantifiers the first quantifier
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:31,5:58,called quantifiers the first quantifier called quantifiers the first quantifier is the universal quantifier a universal quantifier stands for the a universal quantifier stands for the expression for all for example when we expression for all for example when we expression for all for example when we say for all x p x what we mean is that
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:58,6:33,say for all x p x what we mean is that say for all x p x what we mean is that for every x px is true the other quantifier is the existential the other quantifier is the existential quantifier using an existential quantifier when we using an existential quantifier when we say that when we write a formula of the

202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,6:44,6:53,the rexes what we essentially say is to the rexes what we essentially say is to say is that there exists an x such that say is that there exists an x such that say is that there exists an x such that p of x this true p of x this true
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,6:53,7:02,p of x this true so px is a predicate with an argument so px is a predicate with an argument so px is a predicate with an argument supplied x is the argument here so that supplied x is the argument here so that supplied x is the argument here so that will take on a tooth value as we have
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,7:02,7:08,will take on a tooth value as we have will take on a tooth value as we have seen before seen before seen before so this statement is supposed to say so this statement is supposed to say so this statement is supposed to say that the rex is an x such that p of x is
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,7:08,7:25,that the rex is an x such that p of x is that the rex is an x such that p of x is true now in these statements we say for true now in these statements we say for true now in these statements we say for all x or their axis and x such that some

202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,7:30,7:39,so that some renegade qx is satisfied so that some renegade qx is satisfied but then what do we mean by for all x but then what do we mean by for all x but then what do we mean by for all x what kind of x do we talk about here and
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,7:39,7:45,what kind of x do we talk about here and what kind of x do we talk about here and here there x is an x where this question here there x is an x where this question here there x is an x where this question is not clear when we say for all x order
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,7:45,8:05,is not clear when we say for all x order is not clear when we say for all x order xs and x xs and x xs and x now these quantified statements happen now these quantified statements happen now these quantified statements happen in a context these happen in a context in a discourse
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,8:05,8:20,these happen in a context in a discourse so from the context of the discourse it so from the context of the discourse it so from the context of the discourse it should be clear what is the domain of should be clear what is the domain of should be clear what is the domain of the discourse the domain of the
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,8:20,8:26,the discourse the domain of the the discourse the domain of the discourse is the set of elements about discourse is the set of elements about discourse is the set of elements about which we are conversing at the moment which we are conversing at the moment which we are conversing at the moment for example we could be talking about
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,8:26,8:42,for example we could be talking about for example we could be talking about natural numbers or we could be talking natural numbers or we could be talking natural numbers or we could be talking about people depending on the domain of about people depending on the domain of about people depending on the domain of discourse the statement that we say
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,8:42,8:57,discourse the statement that we say discourse the statement that we say might make sense for example when we say might make sense for example when we say might make sense for example when we say for all x x is odd or x is even make for all x x is odd or x is even make
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,8:57,9:03,for all x x is odd or x is even make sense if the domain of discourse d is sense if the domain of discourse d is sense if the domain of discourse d is the set of all natural numbers a very the set of all natural numbers a very
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,9:03,9:14,the set of all natural numbers a very natural number of either order even you natural number of either order even you natural number of either order even you can classify natural numbers as or even can classify natural numbers as or even can classify natural numbers as or even or d could be a proper subset of n so in
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,9:14,9:19,or d could be a proper subset of n so in or d could be a proper subset of n so in these contexts the statement axis order these contexts the statement axis order these contexts the statement axis order xs even makes sense because is odd or xs even makes sense because is odd or
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,9:19,9:27,xs even makes sense because is odd or is even predicates do apply to natural is even predicates do apply to natural is even predicates do apply to natural numbers but if you are talking about numbers but if you are talking about numbers but if you are talking about people these statements need not make
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,9:27,9:38,people these statements need not make people these statements need not make sense to make sense of these statements sense to make sense of these statements sense to make sense of these statements we will have to interpret the predicates we will have to interpret the predicates we will have to interpret the predicates is odd and is even in a manner which is
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,9:38,9:43,is odd and is even in a manner which is is odd and is even in a manner which is appropriate to the members of the domain appropriate to the members of the domain appropriate to the members of the domain of discourse of discourse of discourse so if domain of discourse is the set of
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,9:43,9:47,so if domain of discourse is the set of so if domain of discourse is the set of all people then these will have to be all people then these will have to be all people then these will have to be interpreted appropriately in terms of interpreted appropriately in terms of
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,9:47,9:57,interpreted appropriately in terms of the people for this statement to make the people for this statement to make the people for this statement to make sense so for a first radhas statement sense so for a first radhas statement sense so for a first radhas statement to make sense we will have to first fix
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,9:57,10:01,to make sense we will have to first fix to make sense we will have to first fix the domain of discourse so we assume the domain of discourse so we assume the domain of discourse so we assume that in the context in which our that in the context in which our
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,10:01,10:10,that in the context in which our conversation is happening the domain of conversation is happening the domain of conversation is happening the domain of discourse is fixed and in that context discourse is fixed and in that context discourse is fixed and in that context we quantify similarly when we say there
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,10:10,10:26,we quantify similarly when we say there we quantify similarly when we say there are xs and x such that x is prime if the domain of discourse is the set of if the domain of discourse is the set of natural numbers then what do we assert natural numbers then what do we assert
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,10:26,10:47,natural numbers then what do we assert we assert that there is a natural number so once the domain of discourse is fixed so once the domain of discourse is fixed and the predicate is primus understood and the predicate is primus understood and the predicate is primus understood then the sentence makes sense then you
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,10:47,11:04,then the sentence makes sense then you then the sentence makes sense then you can assert whether the statement is true can assert whether the statement is true can assert whether the statement is true or false sometimes we want to make restrictions sometimes we want to make restrictions on the domain of discourse suppose d is
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,11:04,11:09,on the domain of discourse suppose d is on the domain of discourse suppose d is the domain of discourse and let us say the domain of discourse and let us say the domain of discourse and let us say we want to make restrictions so let us we want to make restrictions so let us
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,11:09,11:13,we want to make restrictions so let us assume that d is the set of all natural assume that d is the set of all natural assume that d is the set of all natural numbers and let us say we have a numbers and let us say we have a
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,11:13,11:26,numbers and let us say we have a statement of this form for every x statement of this form for every x statement of this form for every x greater than p of x that is we want greater than p of x that is we want greater than p of x that is we want to assert that the predicate p of x is
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,11:26,11:38,to assert that the predicate p of x is to assert that the predicate p of x is true for every x which is greater than true for every x which is greater than true for every x which is greater than how would we write this in our logic
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,11:38,11:46,how would we write this in our logic how would we write this in our logic using the quantifiers you have to write using the quantifiers you have to write using the quantifiers you have to write this way the x is an x so that when x is this way the x is an x so that when x is
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,11:46,11:53,this way the x is an x so that when x is greater than if x is greater than greater than if x is greater than greater than if x is greater than then p of x is true this is the correct then p of x is true this is the correct
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,11:53,12:01,then p of x is true this is the correct representation of this statement this representation of this statement this representation of this statement this cannot be paraphrased as this is an cannot be paraphrased as this is an cannot be paraphrased as this is an often made mistake often made mistake
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,12:01,12:13,often made mistake people often write this way the second people often write this way the second people often write this way the second statement says that the rexes the for statement says that the rexes the for statement says that the rexes the for every x x is greater than and p of x
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,12:13,12:24,every x x is greater than and p of x every x x is greater than and p of x this would be true if and only if every this would be true if and only if every this would be true if and only if every x is greater than and for every x px
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,12:24,12:29,x is greater than and for every x px x is greater than and for every x px is true that is not what we intend to is true that is not what we intend to is true that is not what we intend to say what we intend to say is that for
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,12:29,12:35,say what we intend to say is that for say what we intend to say is that for every x which is greater than p of x every x which is greater than p of x every x which is greater than p of x is true these two are not the same at
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,12:35,12:42,is true these two are not the same at is true these two are not the same at all but these two you can see are the all but these two you can see are the all but these two you can see are the same so this is the correct paraphrasing
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,12:42,12:47,same so this is the correct paraphrasing same so this is the correct paraphrasing of the sentence the quantified sentence of the sentence the quantified sentence of the sentence the quantified sentence for every x greater than p of x and for every x greater than p of x and
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,12:47,13:15,for every x greater than p of x and then you can make an assertion of the then you can make an assertion of the then you can make an assertion of the sort the xs and x then we would write this as there is an then we would write this as there is an x greater than such that p of x is
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,13:15,13:20,x greater than such that p of x is x greater than such that p of x is what we want to say and we would write what we want to say and we would write what we want to say and we would write it in this way you should remember that
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,13:20,13:31,it in this way you should remember that it in this way you should remember that here x greater than implies px will here x greater than implies px will here x greater than implies px will not do thats because this says that the not do thats because this says that the
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,13:31,13:47,not do thats because this says that the reason x such that either x is less than reason x such that either x is less than reason x such that either x is less than or equal to or p of x what we assert or equal to or p of x what we assert
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,13:47,13:51,or equal to or p of x what we assert is that x greater than implies p of x is that x greater than implies p of x is that x greater than implies p of x so from what we saw in the last lecture so from what we saw in the last lecture
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,13:51,14:06,so from what we saw in the last lecture we know that alpha implies beta is we know that alpha implies beta is we know that alpha implies beta is logically equivalent to negation of logically equivalent to negation of logically equivalent to negation of alpha or beta therefore x greater than
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,14:06,14:13,alpha or beta therefore x greater than alpha or beta therefore x greater than implies p x would paraphrase as x implies p x would paraphrase as x implies p x would paraphrase as x less than or equal to or p x but less than or equal to or p x but
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,14:13,14:22,less than or equal to or p x but these two statements are not the same at these two statements are not the same at these two statements are not the same at all therefore this is the correct all therefore this is the correct all therefore this is the correct representation of the top statement so
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,14:22,14:35,representation of the top statement so representation of the top statement so we can write statements of this sort we can write statements of this sort we can write statements of this sort using quantifiers so the extension of using quantifiers so the extension of using quantifiers so the extension of propositional calculus in propositional
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,14:35,14:46,propositional calculus in propositional propositional calculus in propositional calculus we have propositions these are calculus we have propositions these are calculus we have propositions these are the syntactic entities and composite the syntactic entities and composite the syntactic entities and composite propositions which are made from atomic propositions which are made from atomic
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,14:46,14:55,propositions which are made from atomic propositions and the truth values which propositions and the truth values which propositions and the truth values which are the semantic entities so these are are the semantic entities so these are are the semantic entities so these are what we deal with in propositional
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,14:55,15:08,what we deal with in propositional what we deal with in propositional calculus but when we come to this logic calculus but when we come to this logic calculus but when we come to this logic which we called firstorder logic recall propositional calculus is also recall propositional calculus is also called zerothorder logic as opposed to

202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,15:23,15:37,calculus to firstorder logic or calculus to firstorder logic or predicate logic we have variables predicate logic we have variables predicate logic we have variables variables are akin to pronouns in variables are akin to pronouns in variables are akin to pronouns in english constants constants are similar english constants constants are similar

202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,16:48,17:04,of propositional calculus are still with us along with these additions so this us along with these additions so this us along with these additions so this richard logic is called the firstorder richard logic is called the firstorder richard logic is called the firstorder logic or predicate logic quantifiers
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,17:04,17:26,then connectives in the last lecture we then connectives in the last lecture we discussed presidents of connectives we discussed presidents of connectives we discussed presidents of connectives we saw that negation has the highest saw that negation has the highest saw that negation has the highest precedence and double implication has
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,17:26,17:32,precedence and double implication has precedence and double implication has the least presidents but quantifiers the least presidents but quantifiers the least presidents but quantifiers take a precedence which is higher than take a precedence which is higher than take a precedence which is higher than that of all the connectives including
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,17:32,17:58,that of all the connectives including that of all the connectives including negation therefore a statement of the negation therefore a statement of the negation therefore a statement of the form for all x px or qx should be form for all x px or qx should be form for all x px or qx should be interpreted as for all x px or qx that

202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,18:47,19:08,not know what x is so x is to be not know what x is so x is to be inferred from the context so in that sense x is like a pronoun in so in that sense x is like a pronoun in english we say that x is free in the
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,19:08,19:13,english we say that x is free in the english we say that x is free in the statement x greater than three the statement x greater than three the statement x greater than three the occurrence of x is free in x greater occurrence of x is free in x greater

202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,19:21,19:27,say for all x x greater than three of course the statement would be false if course the statement would be false if course the statement would be false if we are talking about natural numbers but we are talking about natural numbers but we are talking about natural numbers but never mind we are not talking about the
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,19:27,19:31,never mind we are not talking about the never mind we are not talking about the truth value of the statement look at the truth value of the statement look at the truth value of the statement look at the statement the form of this statement in statement the form of this statement in

202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,19:38,20:00,than three so in this statement x has a bound occurrence this occurrence of x is bound to this this occurrence of x is bound to this quantifier so variables can have a free quantifier so variables can have a free quantifier so variables can have a free and bound occurrences it is also
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,20:00,20:09,and bound occurrences it is also and bound occurrences it is also possible to mix free and bound possible to mix free and bound possible to mix free and bound occurrences within the same statement occurrences within the same statement occurrences within the same statement for example when i have a statement of
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,20:09,20:20,for example when i have a statement of for example when i have a statement of this form x less than and for all x this form x less than and for all x this form x less than and for all x x greater than this occurrence of x is
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,20:20,20:30,x greater than this occurrence of x is x greater than this occurrence of x is bound to the x in the quantifier so this bound to the x in the quantifier so this bound to the x in the quantifier so this is a bound occurrence of x whereas this
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,20:30,20:38,is a bound occurrence of x whereas this is a bound occurrence of x whereas this is a free occurrence so this x is is a free occurrence so this x is is a free occurrence so this x is talking about some individual which is talking about some individual which is
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,20:38,20:45,talking about some individual which is known only from the context so its known only from the context so its known only from the context so its rather like a pronoun rather like a pronoun rather like a pronoun whereas this second x is bound to the x whereas this second x is bound to the x
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,20:45,21:11,whereas this second x is bound to the x in the quantifier so that doesnt depend in the quantifier so that doesnt depend in the quantifier so that doesnt depend on the context this is similar to a the tigress is free thats one sentence the tigress is free thats one sentence that provides a context and let us say
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,21:11,21:41,that provides a context and let us say that provides a context and let us say in the second state the sentence we have shes coming here and now it is everyone shes coming here and now it is everyone for herself so consider the second sentence in the so consider the second sentence in the sentence the pronoun she occurs in two
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,21:41,21:49,sentence the pronoun she occurs in two sentence the pronoun she occurs in two places that is similar to x in the places that is similar to x in the places that is similar to x in the statement x less than hundred and for statement x less than hundred and for
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,21:49,21:57,statement x less than hundred and for all x x greater than three the first she all x x greater than three the first she all x x greater than three the first she is a free occurrence of the pronoun the is a free occurrence of the pronoun the
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,21:57,22:05,is a free occurrence of the pronoun the meaning of this she has to be inferred meaning of this she has to be inferred meaning of this she has to be inferred from the context now what is the context from the context now what is the context from the context now what is the context in the context the previous sentence
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,22:05,22:18,in the context the previous sentence in the context the previous sentence says that the tigris is free therefore says that the tigris is free therefore says that the tigris is free therefore this she refers to this tygris but the this she refers to this tygris but the this she refers to this tygris but the she in herself is a bound occurrence it
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,22:18,22:28,she in herself is a bound occurrence it she in herself is a bound occurrence it is bound to everyone so we have a group is bound to everyone so we have a group is bound to everyone so we have a group of women facing the tiger of women facing the tiger
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,22:28,22:37,of women facing the tiger so this quantification is over this so this quantification is over this so this quantification is over this group of women facing the tiger group of women facing the tiger group of women facing the tiger so everyone refers to the individuals so everyone refers to the individuals
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,22:37,22:50,so everyone refers to the individuals within this group so the xi in herself within this group so the xi in herself within this group so the xi in herself is bound to this occurrence of x is bound to this occurrence of x is bound to this occurrence of x consider the statement for all x p of x
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,22:50,23:00,consider the statement for all x p of x consider the statement for all x p of x so as we said before this says that for so as we said before this says that for so as we said before this says that for all x in the domain of discourse d p of
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,23:00,23:12,all x in the domain of discourse d p of all x in the domain of discourse d p of x is true suppose we want to negate this then we suppose we want to negate this then we want to say that this is not the case want to say that this is not the case

202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,23:23,23:32,to say that it is not the case that for every x p of x is then clearly every x p of x is then clearly every x p of x is then clearly somebody violates p of x that is if you somebody violates p of x that is if you
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,23:32,23:37,somebody violates p of x that is if you go to every individual belonging to the go to every individual belonging to the go to every individual belonging to the set d we would sign find that p of x is set d we would sign find that p of x is
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,23:37,23:49,set d we would sign find that p of x is not satisfied by everybody so there is not satisfied by everybody so there is not satisfied by everybody so there is somebody who doesnt satisfy b of x in somebody who doesnt satisfy b of x in somebody who doesnt satisfy b of x in other words some x belonging to b
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,23:49,24:04,other words some x belonging to b other words some x belonging to b doesnt satisfy the predicate b or in doesnt satisfy the predicate b or in doesnt satisfy the predicate b or in other words there are xs and x within d other words there are xs and x within d
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,24:04,24:14,other words there are xs and x within d so that p of x is not satisfied so we so that p of x is not satisfied so we so that p of x is not satisfied so we find that these two statements are find that these two statements are
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,24:14,24:28,find that these two statements are equivalent that is the negation of for equivalent that is the negation of for equivalent that is the negation of for all xpx is the same as their x is x not all xpx is the same as their x is x not all xpx is the same as their x is x not of px of course but on the size
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,24:28,24:33,of px of course but on the size of px of course but on the size incorrectly we will use this convention incorrectly we will use this convention incorrectly we will use this convention of parenthesis you will find in of parenthesis you will find in of parenthesis you will find in literature that there are different ways

202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,24:55,25:01,such a parenthesis parenthesis ation is such a parenthesis parenthesis ation is not done then for all x will associate not done then for all x will associate not done then for all x will associate to the nearest relegate it has the to the nearest relegate it has the
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,25:01,25:18,to the nearest relegate it has the highest precedence as we said before similarly let us try to negate this similarly let us try to negate this statement the rexis annex so that p of x statement the rexis annex so that p of x statement the rexis annex so that p of x let us say we want to negate this so
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,25:18,25:45,let us say we want to negate this so let us say we want to negate this so what this asserts is that there does not what this asserts is that there does not what this asserts is that there does not exist or in other words if you go to the
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,25:45,26:09,or in other words if you go to the individual members of d we will find individual members of d we will find individual members of d we will find that p of x is violated by every x in d or in other words for all x p of x is
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,26:09,26:32,or in other words for all x p of x is violated so these two equivalent source you can avoid these parenthesis and you can avoid these parenthesis and simplify the expression it says that the simplify the expression it says that the simplify the expression it says that the x is x so that p of x is violated if it
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,26:32,26:36,x is x so that p of x is violated if it x is x so that p of x is violated if it is not the case that p of x is true for is not the case that p of x is true for is not the case that p of x is true for everybody then there must be some x for
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,26:36,26:47,everybody then there must be some x for everybody then there must be some x for which p of x is violated analogously if which p of x is violated analogously if which p of x is violated analogously if there doesnt exist an x so that p of x
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,26:47,27:00,there doesnt exist an x so that p of x there doesnt exist an x so that p of x is true then for every x p of x must be is true then for every x p of x must be is true then for every x p of x must be false these two are called
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,27:00,27:28,let us try a few examples paraphrasing let us try a few examples paraphrasing sentences in english in two sentences in sentences in english in two sentences in sentences in english in two sentences in first order logic these examples are first order logic these examples are first order logic these examples are from the textbook of mendelssohn anyone
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,27:28,27:52,from the textbook of mendelssohn anyone from the textbook of mendelssohn anyone whos persistent can learn logic we want to translate this sentence in we want to translate this sentence in english into a firstorder formula so english into a firstorder formula so english into a firstorder formula so let us consider the predicates here is
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,27:52,28:12,let us consider the predicates here is let us consider the predicates here is persistent is one predicate can learn persistent is one predicate can learn persistent is one predicate can learn logic is another predicate so we can logic is another predicate so we can logic is another predicate so we can have p of x stand for x is persistent we
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,28:12,28:26,have p of x stand for x is persistent we have p of x stand for x is persistent we can have c of x stand for x can learn can have c of x stand for x can learn can have c of x stand for x can learn logic then what we essentially assert us
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,28:26,28:40,logic then what we essentially assert us logic then what we essentially assert us that any person whos persistent is that any person whos persistent is that any person whos persistent is capable of learning logic in other words capable of learning logic in other words capable of learning logic in other words for every x when x is a person that is
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,28:40,28:53,for every x when x is a person that is for every x when x is a person that is our domain of discourse with a set of our domain of discourse with a set of our domain of discourse with a set of people for every x where x belongs to d that is
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,28:53,29:03,for every x where x belongs to d that is understood the domain of discourse is understood the domain of discourse is understood the domain of discourse is understood for every x if x is understood for every x if x is understood for every x if x is persistent then x can learn logic this
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,29:03,29:18,persistent then x can learn logic this persistent then x can learn logic this would be the first order representation would be the first order representation would be the first order representation of the sentence consider another of the sentence consider another of the sentence consider another statement no politician is honest
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,29:18,29:31,the debatable statement but there we the debatable statement but there we have it let us consider the compliment have it let us consider the compliment have it let us consider the compliment of this statement the compliment of this of this statement the compliment of this of this statement the compliment of this statement would say that some politician
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,29:31,29:37,statement would say that some politician statement would say that some politician is honest some politicians are honest or is honest some politicians are honest or is honest some politicians are honest or in other words theyre accessible in other words theyre accessible in other words theyre accessible addition who is honest
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,29:37,29:44,addition who is honest addition who is honest so let us sit there x is an x in d the so let us sit there x is an x in d the so let us sit there x is an x in d the domain of discourse is the set of people
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,29:44,29:50,domain of discourse is the set of people domain of discourse is the set of people here again so there x is an x so that x here again so there x is an x so that x here again so there x is an x so that x is a politician so in this case p stands
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,29:50,30:01,is a politician so in this case p stands is a politician so in this case p stands for the predicate is politician so px for the predicate is politician so px for the predicate is politician so px means x is a politician and honest x so means x is a politician and honest x so
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,30:01,30:09,means x is a politician and honest x so we have the statement there is some x we have the statement there is some x we have the statement there is some x whose both a politician and honest that whose both a politician and honest that whose both a politician and honest that would be a negation of the statement now
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,30:09,30:17,would be a negation of the statement now would be a negation of the statement now what we want here is to negate this no what we want here is to negate this no what we want here is to negate this no politician is honest so here we have a
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,30:17,30:23,politician is honest so here we have a politician is honest so here we have a negation of quantified statement then we negation of quantified statement then we negation of quantified statement then we can apply de morgans laws to take the can apply de morgans laws to take the
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,30:23,30:34,can apply de morgans laws to take the negation inside so from the de morgans negation inside so from the de morgans negation inside so from the de morgans laws we know that when negation is taken laws we know that when negation is taken laws we know that when negation is taken inside a quantified formula it changes
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,30:34,30:42,inside a quantified formula it changes inside a quantified formula it changes the quantifier for example when a the quantifier for example when a the quantifier for example when a negation travels over a universal negation travels over a universal negation travels over a universal quantifier into the parenthesis then the
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,30:42,30:52,quantifier into the parenthesis then the quantifier into the parenthesis then the universal quantifier changes into the universal quantifier changes into the universal quantifier changes into the existential quantifier this universal existential quantifier this universal existential quantifier this universal quantifier changes into an existential quantifier changes into an existential quantifier changes into an existential quantifier when the negation travels
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,30:52,31:10,quantifier when the negation travels quantifier when the negation travels inside the brackets similarly when the negation travels over an when the negation travels over an existential quantifier existential quantifier existential quantifier inside the paranthesis it converts the inside the paranthesis it converts the inside the paranthesis it converts the existential quantifier into a universal
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,31:10,31:23,existential quantifier into a universal existential quantifier into a universal quantifier so let us use that here and quantifier so let us use that here and quantifier so let us use that here and pick the negation inside then this pick the negation inside then this pick the negation inside then this becomes for all x and we have the
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,31:23,31:34,becomes for all x and we have the becomes for all x and we have the negation of p x and hx but the negation negation of p x and hx but the negation negation of p x and hx but the negation of p x and hx can be found using the de
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,31:34,31:42,of p x and hx can be found using the de of p x and hx can be found using the de morgans laws of firstorder logic which morgans laws of firstorder logic which morgans laws of firstorder logic which would be here we have the negation of a would be here we have the negation of a
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,31:42,31:51,would be here we have the negation of a conjunction the negation of a conjunction the negation of a conjunction the negation of a conjunction is the disjunction of the conjunction is the disjunction of the conjunction is the disjunction of the negations so we have negation of p of x
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,31:51,32:12,negations so we have negation of p of x negations so we have negation of p of x or negation of h of x which is logically or negation of h of x which is logically or negation of h of x which is logically equivalent to saying this so what does it say for every x if x is
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,32:12,32:18,so what does it say for every x if x is a politician then x is not honest x is a politician then x is not honest x is a politician then x is not honest x is dishonest dishonest dishonest so that is tantamount to asserting that so that is tantamount to asserting that
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,32:18,32:26,so that is tantamount to asserting that every politician is dishonest which is every politician is dishonest which is every politician is dishonest which is logically equivalent to saying that no logically equivalent to saying that no logically equivalent to saying that no politician is honest similarly consider politician is honest similarly consider
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,32:26,32:48,politician is honest similarly consider the statement not all birds can fly suppose we want to say that everybody suppose we want to say that everybody can fly then we would say for every x if can fly then we would say for every x if can fly then we would say for every x if x is a bird then x can fly here b of x
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,32:48,32:53,x is a bird then x can fly here b of x x is a bird then x can fly here b of x stands for accessible and f of x stands stands for accessible and f of x stands stands for accessible and f of x stands for x can fly so the statement asserts
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,32:53,33:00,for x can fly so the statement asserts for x can fly so the statement asserts that every bird can fly suppose we want that every bird can fly suppose we want that every bird can fly suppose we want to negate this then we would have the to negate this then we would have the
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,33:00,33:09,to negate this then we would have the required assertion so that says that not required assertion so that says that not required assertion so that says that not all birds can fly once again if you take all birds can fly once again if you take all birds can fly once again if you take the negation inside the brackets the
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,33:09,33:18,the negation inside the brackets the the negation inside the brackets the quantifier flips we have the rexis then quantifier flips we have the rexis then quantifier flips we have the rexis then we have the negation of the implication we have the negation of the implication we have the negation of the implication b of x implies f of x but the negation
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,33:18,33:24,b of x implies f of x but the negation b of x implies f of x but the negation of an implication is the conjunction of of an implication is the conjunction of of an implication is the conjunction of the antecedent and the negation of the the antecedent and the negation of the
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,33:24,33:53,the antecedent and the negation of the consequent which means we have b of x consequent which means we have b of x consequent which means we have b of x and f of x what does this say there exists an annex there is x such there exists an annex there is x such that bird of x and not of f of x in
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,33:53,34:06,that bird of x and not of f of x in that bird of x and not of f of x in other words there is a bird that cannot other words there is a bird that cannot other words there is a bird that cannot fly you see that this is logically
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,34:06,34:34,you see that this is logically equivalent to our original statement not equivalent to our original statement not equivalent to our original statement not all birds can fly anyone can solve the problem lets make anyone can solve the problem lets make an let us say s s of x denotes the

202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,46:49,46:54,of this implication is true so we make of this implication is true so we make these two assumptions for all x px these two assumptions for all x px these two assumptions for all x px implies qx is true and for all xpx is implies qx is true and for all xpx is
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,46:54,47:06,implies qx is true and for all xpx is true then consider any x belonging to d true then consider any x belonging to d true then consider any x belonging to d for this x we have that px implies q x for this x we have that px implies q x
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,47:06,47:19,for this x we have that px implies q x is and px is true you can readily is and px is true you can readily is and px is true you can readily verify that px implies q x and px verify that px implies q x and px
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,47:19,47:33,verify that px implies q x and px together ensures that px and qx are both together ensures that px and qx are both together ensures that px and qx are both true or in particular qx is true true or in particular qx is true true or in particular qx is true therefore this is true for every single
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,47:33,47:38,therefore this is true for every single therefore this is true for every single x we have taken an arbitrary x and d x we have taken an arbitrary x and d x we have taken an arbitrary x and d therefore we can assert that for all x therefore we can assert that for all x
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,47:38,48:03,therefore we can assert that for all x qx the next year so we have shown that for the next year so we have shown that for all xpx assuming these two therefore the all xpx assuming these two therefore the all xpx assuming these two therefore the formula has to be logically valid that
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,48:03,48:11,formula has to be logically valid that formula has to be logically valid that is in that implication the antecedent is in that implication the antecedent is in that implication the antecedent and also the antecedent of the and also the antecedent of the and also the antecedent of the consequent are both true and we show
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,48:11,48:18,consequent are both true and we show consequent are both true and we show that the consequent within that global that the consequent within that global that the consequent within that global consequent is also true therefore the consequent is also true therefore the consequent is also true therefore the formula is true always that is it

202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,48:51,48:57,implies q x need not be true that will implies q x need not be true that will depend on the interpretation for p and q depend on the interpretation for p and q depend on the interpretation for p and q let us consider an interpretation which let us consider an interpretation which
202.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,48:57,49:09,let us consider an interpretation which will make this formula false let us say will make this formula false let us say will make this formula false let us say the domain of discourse is the set of the domain of discourse is the set of the domain of discourse is the set of people let us say p of x stands for x is

203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:13,2:19,alpha is true for x as well as for phi y alpha is true for x as well as for phi y then x must be equal to y that is there then x must be equal to y that is there then x must be equal to y that is there cannot exist two distinct x and y so
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:19,2:24,cannot exist two distinct x and y so cannot exist two distinct x and y so that alpha holds for both of them so that alpha holds for both of them so that alpha holds for both of them so this is exactly analogues to saying that this is exactly analogues to saying that

203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:44,3:52,that alpha of x is satisfied so alpha x is satisfied by some individuals in the is satisfied by some individuals in the is satisfied by some individuals in the domain but there are multiple domain but there are multiple domain but there are multiple individuals that satisfies alpha of x so
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:52,3:57,individuals that satisfies alpha of x so individuals that satisfies alpha of x so the statement that there is a unique x the statement that there is a unique x the statement that there is a unique x so that alpha of x is true is not right so that alpha of x is true is not right
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:57,4:10,so that alpha of x is true is not right in many firstorder systems we have a in many firstorder systems we have a in many firstorder systems we have a special road for the equality predicate special road for the equality predicate special road for the equality predicate so equality is a predicate which
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:10,4:19,so equality is a predicate which so equality is a predicate which satisfies some conditions the conditions satisfies some conditions the conditions satisfies some conditions the conditions are this frolics we can assert that x is are this frolics we can assert that x is are this frolics we can assert that x is equal to x for every individual that

203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,6:05,6:19,example let us say we have a formula of example let us say we have a formula of this form for all y p of x implies q of this form for all y p of x implies q of this form for all y p of x implies q of y and let us say we want to substitute y
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,6:19,6:26,y and let us say we want to substitute y y and let us say we want to substitute y for x in this x is a free variable here for x in this x is a free variable here for x in this x is a free variable here but if you substitute variable y for x
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,6:26,6:35,but if you substitute variable y for x but if you substitute variable y for x here here here we would get the formula for all y p of we would get the formula for all y p of we would get the formula for all y p of y implies q a fight but then this
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,6:35,6:44,y implies q a fight but then this y implies q a fight but then this substitution is now caught by this substitution is now caught by this substitution is now caught by this quantifier which can change the intended quantifier which can change the intended quantifier which can change the intended meaning of the formula so what does the
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,6:44,6:52,meaning of the formula so what does the meaning of the formula so what does the first formula say the first formula says first formula say the first formula says first formula say the first formula says that if p is true for x then for every y that if p is true for x then for every y
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,6:52,7:14,that if p is true for x then for every y q is true that is what it effectively q is true that is what it effectively q is true that is what it effectively says in other words if i take p of x as x is angry and q of y as y squared then
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,7:14,7:19,x is angry and q of y as y squared then what is the first formula say the first what is the first formula say the first what is the first formula say the first formula says that for every y if x is formula says that for every y if x is
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,7:19,7:28,formula says that for every y if x is angry then y is scared if x happens to angry then y is scared if x happens to angry then y is scared if x happens to be a despotic dictator then it could be be a despotic dictator then it could be
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,7:28,7:35,be a despotic dictator then it could be true if the dictator was angry then true if the dictator was angry then true if the dictator was angry then everybody is scared but then what does everybody is scared but then what does everybody is scared but then what does the second statement say with the
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,7:35,7:44,the second statement say with the the second statement say with the quantifier for y catching the quantifier for y catching the quantifier for y catching the substituted occurrence of y we have a substituted occurrence of y we have a substituted occurrence of y we have a statement like for every y if y is angry
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,7:44,7:49,statement like for every y if y is angry statement like for every y if y is angry then y scared which means any angry then y scared which means any angry then y scared which means any angry person is scared which is not true at person is scared which is not true at
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,7:49,7:56,person is scared which is not true at all and that is not the indented all and that is not the indented all and that is not the indented substitution therefore while substitution therefore while substitution therefore while substituting for one variable you have substituting for one variable you have
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,7:56,8:06,substituting for one variable you have to be careful the substitution cannot be to be careful the substitution cannot be to be careful the substitution cannot be caught by any existing quantifier let us caught by any existing quantifier let us caught by any existing quantifier let us take an example which would explain the
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,8:06,8:16,take an example which would explain the take an example which would explain the notion of logical consequences notion of logical consequences notion of logical consequences so we consider firstorder logic with so we consider firstorder logic with so we consider firstorder logic with equality so equality predicate is equality so equality predicate is
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,8:16,8:26,equality so equality predicate is available within the logic with the available within the logic with the available within the logic with the properties we mentioned let us say we properties we mentioned let us say we properties we mentioned let us say we have three predicate symbols pl and o p
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,8:26,8:40,have three predicate symbols pl and o p have three predicate symbols pl and o p is a unary predicate l is also a unary is a unary predicate l is also a unary is a unary predicate l is also a unary predicate and o is a binary predicate we
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,8:40,9:04,predicate and o is a binary predicate we predicate and o is a binary predicate we indent p of x to stand for x is a point l of x stands for x is a line o of x y l of x stands for x is a line o of x y stands for x lies on y so with these
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,9:04,9:12,stands for x lies on y so with these stands for x lies on y so with these predicate symbols let us write a few predicate symbols let us write a few predicate symbols let us write a few formulae and see what the meaning is by formulae and see what the meaning is by
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,9:12,9:26,formulae and see what the meaning is by gamma we define a set of formulae a set gamma we define a set of formulae a set gamma we define a set of formulae a set of three formulae p p and p so let of three formulae p p and p so let
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,9:26,9:33,of three formulae p p and p so let us now see what these formulae are p us now see what these formulae are p us now see what these formulae are p is the formula which says that for all x is the formula which says that for all x
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,9:33,9:46,is the formula which says that for all x for all y x is a point y is a point and for all y x is a point y is a point and for all y x is a point y is a point and x not equal to y implies that that x is
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,9:46,10:00,x not equal to y implies that that x is x not equal to y implies that that x is a unique z so that z is a line and x a unique z so that z is a line and x a unique z so that z is a line and x lies on z and y lies on set
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,10:00,10:10,so this is the formula that we denote as so this is the formula that we denote as p what does this formula say for every p what does this formula say for every p what does this formula say for every pair of points x and y that are not the

203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,11:01,11:15,them so this is the formula that we call p now let us see p p asserts that for p now let us see p p asserts that for p now let us see p p asserts that for every z if z is a line then their exes x
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,11:15,11:29,every z if z is a line then their exes x every z if z is a line then their exes x and y so that x is a point y is a point and y so that x is a point y is a point and y so that x is a point y is a point x is not equal to y and x lies on z and
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,11:29,11:40,x is not equal to y and x lies on z and x is not equal to y and x lies on z and y lies on z so what does it say for y lies on z so what does it say for y lies on z so what does it say for every line z there is a pair of points x
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,11:40,11:46,every line z there is a pair of points x every line z there is a pair of points x and y so that x is not the same as y and y so that x is not the same as y and y so that x is not the same as y which means that x is a pair of distinct
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,11:46,11:53,which means that x is a pair of distinct which means that x is a pair of distinct points so that x lies on z and while i points so that x lies on z and while i points so that x lies on z and while i sunset or in other words in every line

203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,16:30,16:35,given a line and a point which is not on the line through that point we can draw the line through that point we can draw the line through that point we can draw a parallel to the original line so this a parallel to the original line so this
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,16:35,16:40,a parallel to the original line so this is our line x and this is the line this is our line x and this is the line this is our line x and this is the line this is the point y through y we can draw our is the point y through y we can draw our
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,16:40,16:47,is the point y through y we can draw our line z which is parallel to x z and x do line z which is parallel to x z and x do line z which is parallel to x z and x do not intersect so you could paraphrase not intersect so you could paraphrase
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,16:47,16:53,not intersect so you could paraphrase those paraphrase the statement like this those paraphrase the statement like this those paraphrase the statement like this given a line x and the point why not on given a line x and the point why not on given a line x and the point why not on x there exists a unique line z passing
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,16:53,17:00,x there exists a unique line z passing x there exists a unique line z passing through y so that x and z do not through y so that x and z do not through y so that x and z do not intersect so let us write the first
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,17:00,17:10,intersect so let us write the first intersect so let us write the first order representation of the statement we order representation of the statement we order representation of the statement we say for every x and every y so that x is say for every x and every y so that x is

203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,17:57,18:02,lies on both the lines so that is what we negate here for every x and y so that we negate here for every x and y so that we negate here for every x and y so that x is a line and y is a point and why
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,18:02,18:10,x is a line and y is a point and why x is a line and y is a point and why does not lie on x there exists a unique does not lie on x there exists a unique does not lie on x there exists a unique z which is a line so that there does not
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,18:10,18:18,z which is a line so that there does not z which is a line so that there does not exist a point w that lies both on x and exist a point w that lies both on x and exist a point w that lies both on x and z so this is the euclidean parallel

203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,24:33,24:41,is associated to the set a b and c are the points so we say the set of points the points so we say the set of points the points so we say the set of points is a b and c and we say the set of lines is a b and c and we say the set of lines

203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,26:15,26:21,b that passes through them so in this b that passes through them so in this case there is a unique line l which case there is a unique line l which case there is a unique line l which contains both a and b so the statement contains both a and b so the statement
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,26:21,26:26,contains both a and b so the statement p is true for a and b and the statement p is true for a and b and the statement p is true for a and b and the statement is true for bc as well is true for bc as well
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,26:26,26:31,is true for bc as well you take the two points b and c there is you take the two points b and c there is you take the two points b and c there is a unique set bc which contains them a unique set bc which contains them
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,26:31,26:37,a unique set bc which contains them among the lines so there is a unique among the lines so there is a unique among the lines so there is a unique line that contains both b and c line that contains both b and c line that contains both b and c similarly there is a unique line which
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,26:37,26:44,similarly there is a unique line which similarly there is a unique line which contains both a and c so the first contains both a and c so the first contains both a and c so the first proposition is true p is correct what proposition is true p is correct what

203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,26:54,27:00,again the case here there are only three again the case here there are only three lines here a b bc and ca are the three lines here a b bc and ca are the three lines here a b bc and ca are the three lines in each of these lines there are
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,27:00,27:09,lines in each of these lines there are lines in each of these lines there are exactly two points so p is also exactly two points so p is also exactly two points so p is also satisfied what about p p asserts satisfied what about p p asserts satisfied what about p p asserts that the
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,27:09,27:17,that the that the three non collinear points so though three non collinear points so though three non collinear points so though must exist three points all three with must exist three points all three with must exist three points all three with all three not lying on the same line
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,27:17,27:21,all three not lying on the same line all three not lying on the same line which is the case here indeed there are which is the case here indeed there are which is the case here indeed there are three points a b and c and there is no
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,27:21,27:25,three points a b and c and there is no three points a b and c and there is no line which contains all three that is line which contains all three that is line which contains all three that is trivially so because every line contains trivially so because every line contains
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,27:25,27:45,trivially so because every line contains exactly two points here so p is also exactly two points here so p is also exactly two points here so p is also true true true therefore this interpretation makes the therefore this interpretation makes the therefore this interpretation makes the whole of grammar two every formula in
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,27:45,27:50,whole of grammar two every formula in whole of grammar two every formula in gamma namely p p and p are true in gamma namely p p and p are true in gamma namely p p and p are true in this interpretation therefore we say this interpretation therefore we say
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,27:50,28:10,this interpretation therefore we say that this interpretation is a model of that this interpretation is a model of that this interpretation is a model of incidence geometry but now what about the euclidean but now what about the euclidean parallel property we find the nuclear in parallel property we find the nuclear in
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,28:10,28:26,parallel property we find the nuclear in peril property is not true in this peril property is not true in this peril property is not true in this interpretation that is because when we interpretation that is because when we interpretation that is because when we consider line bc and appoint a not on bc
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,28:26,28:31,consider line bc and appoint a not on bc consider line bc and appoint a not on bc for euclidean parallel property to be for euclidean parallel property to be for euclidean parallel property to be true there should be a unique line true there should be a unique line
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,28:31,28:42,true there should be a unique line through a which does not intersect b see through a which does not intersect b see through a which does not intersect b see here there are two lines through a one here there are two lines through a one here there are two lines through a one is a b which in the six bc a b
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,28:42,28:48,is a b which in the six bc a b is a b which in the six bc a b intersection bc is b similarly the other intersection bc is b similarly the other intersection bc is b similarly the other line through a which is a c also in the
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,28:48,28:55,line through a which is a c also in the line through a which is a c also in the six bc so euclidean parallel property is six bc so euclidean parallel property is six bc so euclidean parallel property is violated here in particular here we find violated here in particular here we find
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,28:55,29:04,violated here in particular here we find that the elliptic parallel property is that the elliptic parallel property is that the elliptic parallel property is true for any line and a point which is true for any line and a point which is true for any line and a point which is not on the line there is no line
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,29:04,29:10,not on the line there is no line not on the line there is no line parallel to the first line through the parallel to the first line through the parallel to the first line through the point in this case you take line bc and point in this case you take line bc and
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,29:10,29:16,point in this case you take line bc and point a which is not on bc there is no point a which is not on bc there is no point a which is not on bc there is no line through a which is parallel to bc a line through a which is parallel to bc a
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,29:16,29:24,line through a which is parallel to bc a line is parallel to bc if that line is parallel to bc if that line is parallel to bc if that intersects with bc a line in this case intersects with bc a line in this case intersects with bc a line in this case is a set of two points so if you
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,29:24,29:31,is a set of two points so if you is a set of two points so if you interpret a line in this sense then interpret a line in this sense then interpret a line in this sense then elliptic parallel property holds and elliptic parallel property holds and elliptic parallel property holds and therefore in this model of incidence
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,29:31,29:40,therefore in this model of incidence therefore in this model of incidence geometry elliptic parallel property is geometry elliptic parallel property is geometry elliptic parallel property is true euclidean parallel property is true euclidean parallel property is true euclidean parallel property is false but then is elliptic parallel false but then is elliptic parallel
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,29:40,29:49,false but then is elliptic parallel property a logical consequence of property a logical consequence of property a logical consequence of incidence geometry that also is not true incidence geometry that also is not true incidence geometry that also is not true that can be shown with another that can be shown with another
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,29:49,30:19,that can be shown with another interpretation a second interpretation uses a different domain of discourse uses a different domain of discourse here we have four points a b c d and we here we have four points a b c d and we here we have four points a b c d and we have
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,30:19,30:39,that is we consider every two member that is we consider every two member subset of the set abcd so the domain of subset of the set abcd so the domain of subset of the set abcd so the domain of discourse is made up of all these as in
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,30:39,30:48,discourse is made up of all these as in discourse is made up of all these as in the previous interpretation we define b the previous interpretation we define b the previous interpretation we define b the set of points as abcd and l the set the set of points as abcd and l the set

203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,31:02,31:13,ad bc b d and c d so we have four two ad bc b d and c d so we have four two two namely six lines there are four two namely six lines there are four two namely six lines there are four points and six lines once again we can
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,31:13,31:19,points and six lines once again we can points and six lines once again we can verify that propositions p p p are verify that propositions p p p are verify that propositions p p p are true here so here we have four points a true here so here we have four points a
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,31:19,31:30,true here so here we have four points a b c and b and the lines are two member b c and b and the lines are two member b c and b and the lines are two member subsets abc line bd celine cds line ac subsets abc line bd celine cds line ac
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,31:30,31:48,subsets abc line bd celine cds line ac is a line so our ad and bc or to is a line so our ad and bc or to is a line so our ad and bc or to simplify the diagram we could just draw lines this we could just draw lines this corresponds to the set a b this
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,31:48,31:57,corresponds to the set a b this corresponds to the set a b this corresponds to the set c d this is b d corresponds to the set c d this is b d corresponds to the set c d this is b d this is a c bc and ad so in this
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,31:57,32:02,this is a c bc and ad so in this this is a c bc and ad so in this interpretation there are four points in interpretation there are four points in interpretation there are four points in six lines and we find that the six lines and we find that the
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,32:02,32:11,six lines and we find that the statements p p and p are all statements p p and p are all statements p p and p are all satisfied given two distinct points b satisfied given two distinct points b satisfied given two distinct points b and c there is a unique line which
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,32:11,32:19,and c there is a unique line which and c there is a unique line which passes through the two of them namely bc passes through the two of them namely bc passes through the two of them namely bc and p asserts that in every line there and p asserts that in every line there
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,32:19,32:23,and p asserts that in every line there are at least two points which is indeed are at least two points which is indeed are at least two points which is indeed the case a line is made up of two the case a line is made up of two
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,32:23,32:31,the case a line is made up of two distinct points and there are three non distinct points and there are three non distinct points and there are three non collinear points in it applet that can collinear points in it applet that can collinear points in it applet that can be chosen from here for example abc do
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,32:31,32:36,be chosen from here for example abc do be chosen from here for example abc do not lie on the same line thats because not lie on the same line thats because not lie on the same line thats because the line has only two points so p p p
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,32:36,32:46,the line has only two points so p p p the line has only two points so p p p are all satisfied therefore this are all satisfied therefore this are all satisfied therefore this interpretation is a model of incidence interpretation is a model of incidence interpretation is a model of incidence geometry what about the euclidean
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,32:46,32:55,geometry what about the euclidean geometry what about the euclidean parallel property we find that the parallel property we find that the parallel property we find that the euclidean parallel property is true here euclidean parallel property is true here euclidean parallel property is true here take any line bc and a point a which is
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,32:55,33:01,take any line bc and a point a which is take any line bc and a point a which is not on bc then there is a line ad which not on bc then there is a line ad which not on bc then there is a line ad which passes through a and this line doesnt
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,33:01,33:08,passes through a and this line doesnt passes through a and this line doesnt intersect bc doesnt intersect in the intersect bc doesnt intersect in the intersect bc doesnt intersect in the sense that these two lines ac and bd do sense that these two lines ac and bd do
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,33:08,33:16,sense that these two lines ac and bd do not have a common element mind you even not have a common element mind you even not have a common element mind you even though i have drawn the sets using lines though i have drawn the sets using lines though i have drawn the sets using lines they are in fact two member sets the
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,33:16,33:22,they are in fact two member sets the they are in fact two member sets the line ad contains exactly two points a line ad contains exactly two points a line ad contains exactly two points a and d and the line bc contains exactly and d and the line bc contains exactly
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,33:22,33:26,and d and the line bc contains exactly two points b and c these two sets do not two points b and c these two sets do not two points b and c these two sets do not intersect so we can say that ad is intersect so we can say that ad is

203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,35:36,35:49,set abcde and l is the set of all pairs set abcde and l is the set of all pairs of points unordered pairs of points again you can unordered pairs of points again you can verify that p p p are satisfied verify that p p p are satisfied
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,35:49,35:57,verify that p p p are satisfied exactly as before but we find that exactly as before but we find that exactly as before but we find that euclidean parallel property is not euclidean parallel property is not euclidean parallel property is not satisfied thats because if you take a

203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,36:22,36:26,see mind you a line is just a set of two points so set ad doesnt intersect we points so set ad doesnt intersect we points so set ad doesnt intersect we see with bc and set a e also doesnt see with bc and set a e also doesnt
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,36:26,36:34,see with bc and set a e also doesnt intersect with bc therefore we can say intersect with bc therefore we can say intersect with bc therefore we can say that there are two distinct sets that there are two distinct sets that there are two distinct sets containing a that do not intersect with
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,36:34,36:42,containing a that do not intersect with containing a that do not intersect with set bc therefore euclidean parallel set bc therefore euclidean parallel set bc therefore euclidean parallel properties not satisfied elliptic properties not satisfied elliptic properties not satisfied elliptic parallel properties also and i am not parallel properties also and i am not
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,36:42,36:51,parallel properties also and i am not satisfied but we find that hyperbolic satisfied but we find that hyperbolic satisfied but we find that hyperbolic parallel property is satisfied so this parallel property is satisfied so this parallel property is satisfied so this is again a model of incidence geometry
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,36:51,36:58,is again a model of incidence geometry is again a model of incidence geometry since p p p are all satisfied but in since p p p are all satisfied but in since p p p are all satisfied but in this model of incidence geometry this model of incidence geometry

203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,41:37,41:54,not a model of incidence geometry then not a model of incidence geometry then let us formally ask this question what let us formally ask this question what let us formally ask this question what is the logical consequence we have a set of formula gamma and we we have a set of formula gamma and we want to define the logical consequences
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,41:54,42:13,want to define the logical consequences want to define the logical consequences of gamma we say that say that alpha is a of gamma we say that say that alpha is a of gamma we say that say that alpha is a logical consequence of gamma denoted like this alpha is the logical
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,42:13,42:41,denoted like this alpha is the logical consequence of rama if every consequence of rama if every consequence of rama if every interpretation that makes every formula interpretation that makes every formula interpretation that makes every formula in drama true mix alpha also true so for incidence geometry we have seen
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,42:41,42:51,so for incidence geometry we have seen three interpretations in which p p p three interpretations in which p p p three interpretations in which p p p are all true for euclidean parallel are all true for euclidean parallel are all true for euclidean parallel property to be a logical consequence of
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,42:51,42:57,property to be a logical consequence of property to be a logical consequence of incidence geometry it would have had to incidence geometry it would have had to incidence geometry it would have had to be true in all these three be true in all these three be true in all these three interpretations but we find that it is
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,42:57,43:03,interpretations but we find that it is interpretations but we find that it is true in only one of the interpretations true in only one of the interpretations true in only one of the interpretations therefore euclidean parallel property is therefore euclidean parallel property is therefore euclidean parallel property is not a logical consequence of incidence
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,43:03,43:13,not a logical consequence of incidence not a logical consequence of incidence job job job similarly elliptic parallel property is similarly elliptic parallel property is similarly elliptic parallel property is also not a logical consequence of p p also not a logical consequence of p p also not a logical consequence of p p and p the last interpretation that
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,43:13,43:19,and p the last interpretation that and p the last interpretation that we saw did not satisfy p therefore we saw did not satisfy p therefore we saw did not satisfy p therefore that is not a model of incidence that is not a model of incidence that is not a model of incidence geometry so when we investigate
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,43:19,43:26,geometry so when we investigate geometry so when we investigate euclidean parallel property we need not euclidean parallel property we need not euclidean parallel property we need not consider this last interpretation consider this last interpretation consider this last interpretation because this is not a model of instantly because this is not a model of instantly
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,43:26,43:35,because this is not a model of instantly incidence geometry what we have to incidence geometry what we have to incidence geometry what we have to verify is that in every interpretation verify is that in every interpretation verify is that in every interpretation which makes a very formula in the set
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,43:35,43:40,which makes a very formula in the set which makes a very formula in the set gamma namely p p and p must also gamma namely p p and p must also gamma namely p p and p must also make alpha if that is the case we say make alpha if that is the case we say
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,43:40,43:46,make alpha if that is the case we say that alpha is a logical consequence of that alpha is a logical consequence of that alpha is a logical consequence of gamma so it is in the sense that we said gamma so it is in the sense that we said
203.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,43:46,43:55,gamma so it is in the sense that we said that gamma along with all its logical that gamma along with all its logical that gamma along with all its logical consequences forms incidence geometry consequences forms incidence geometry consequences forms incidence geometry okay that is it from this lecture hope

204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:37,1:59,syntax of the language this specifies syntax of the language this specifies what are the grammatical formulae or the grammatical sentences of the or the grammatical sentences of the language then we have the semantics of language then we have the semantics of language then we have the semantics of semantic component of the system the

204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:22,2:47,entities and finally we have a proof entities and finally we have a proof system which is a rewriting system which starts with a set of axioms has a which starts with a set of axioms has a rule of inference has many rules of rule of inference has many rules of
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:47,2:55,rule of inference has many rules of inferences possibly and then using these inferences possibly and then using these inferences possibly and then using these rules of inference it fights new rules of inference it fights new rules of inference it fights new sentences and the process of writing sentences and the process of writing
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:55,3:04,sentences and the process of writing these new sentences is called brewing these new sentences is called brewing these new sentences is called brewing and what we get is a proof so let us now and what we get is a proof so let us now and what we get is a proof so let us now see in detail what these components are
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:04,3:10,see in detail what these components are see in detail what these components are for the two systems of logic that we for the two systems of logic that we for the two systems of logic that we have studied namely propositional have studied namely propositional have studied namely propositional calculus enforced or illogical so let us
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:10,3:39,calculus enforced or illogical so let us calculus enforced or illogical so let us begin with propositional calculus so let us begin with the syntax of so let us begin with the syntax of propositional calculus the syntax is propositional calculus the syntax is propositional calculus the syntax is specified using whats called a drama a
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:39,4:02,grammar as in english for example we can grammar as in english for example we can say a sentence in english is made up of say a sentence in english is made up of say a sentence in english is made up of a subject and a predicate this is what is called the grammatical
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:02,4:11,this is what is called the grammatical rule or a grammatical production so rule or a grammatical production so rule or a grammatical production so likewise we can write a set of likewise we can write a set of likewise we can write a set of productions for the sentences of
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:11,4:29,productions for the sentences of productions for the sentences of propositional calculus the first propositional calculus the first propositional calculus the first production is this here we say that the production is this here we say that the production is this here we say that the grammatical symbol a stands for an
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:29,4:50,grammatical symbol a stands for an grammatical symbol a stands for an atomic proposition so what this grammar atomic proposition so what this grammar atomic proposition so what this grammar rule says is that an atomic proposition rule says is that an atomic proposition rule says is that an atomic proposition could be any one of even through a in
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:50,4:57,could be any one of even through a in could be any one of even through a in here of course this need not even be here of course this need not even be here of course this need not even be finite you might even have an infinite finite you might even have an infinite
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:57,5:06,finite you might even have an infinite number of options so the rule could very number of options so the rule could very number of options so the rule could very well be this let us our system might well be this let us our system might well be this let us our system might have an infinite number of atomic
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:06,5:14,have an infinite number of atomic have an infinite number of atomic propositions which is also possible so propositions which is also possible so propositions which is also possible so this specifies what the atomic this specifies what the atomic this specifies what the atomic propositions are for example the atomic
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:14,5:27,propositions are for example the atomic propositions are for example the atomic propositions could be that a says it propositions could be that a says it propositions could be that a says it is raining events a stands for the is raining events a stands for the is raining events a stands for the atomic proposition it is raining a
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:27,5:52,atomic proposition it is raining a atomic proposition it is raining a might stand for the atomic proposition i might stand for the atomic proposition i might stand for the atomic proposition i do not have an umbrella and iii might stand for i will not get and iii might stand for i will not get wet and so on so your system might have
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:52,5:58,wet and so on so your system might have wet and so on so your system might have several such atomic propositions so this several such atomic propositions so this several such atomic propositions so this is the first grammar rule that we have is the first grammar rule that we have
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:58,6:12,is the first grammar rule that we have then the second grammar rule says that then the second grammar rule says that then the second grammar rule says that the syntactic entity s which stands for the syntactic entity s which stands for the syntactic entity s which stands for a propositional formula formula could be
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,6:12,6:18,a propositional formula formula could be a propositional formula formula could be made up in this fashion what this says made up in this fashion what this says made up in this fashion what this says is that a formula could be the negation is that a formula could be the negation
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,6:18,6:31,is that a formula could be the negation of another formula or it could be an of another formula or it could be an of another formula or it could be an implication one formula implying another implication one formula implying another implication one formula implying another could form a formula or it could be an
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,6:31,6:37,could form a formula or it could be an could form a formula or it could be an attribute formula so this is a recursive attribute formula so this is a recursive attribute formula so this is a recursive specification what it says is that a specification what it says is that a
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,6:37,6:45,specification what it says is that a formula could be a negation of another formula could be a negation of another formula could be a negation of another formula or it could be an implication formula or it could be an implication formula or it could be an implication made up of two formulae which two have
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,6:45,6:51,made up of two formulae which two have made up of two formulae which two have to be synthesized afresh or the formula to be synthesized afresh or the formula to be synthesized afresh or the formula could be a nattering formula so that is could be a nattering formula so that is
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,6:51,7:00,could be a nattering formula so that is where the recursion breaks off so this where the recursion breaks off so this where the recursion breaks off so this is the other grammar rule that we have is the other grammar rule that we have is the other grammar rule that we have for forming propositional formula so you
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,7:00,7:08,for forming propositional formula so you for forming propositional formula so you can see that in this we are using can see that in this we are using can see that in this we are using certain symbols the open and closed certain symbols the open and closed certain symbols the open and closed brackets the negation symbol the

204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,7:46,8:09,a a x at all so let us see an example of synthesizing a formula you could derive negation of s from s as you could derive negation of s from s as the grammar rule shows here a formula the grammar rule shows here a formula the grammar rule shows here a formula could be a negation of a formula so a
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,8:09,8:15,could be a negation of a formula so a could be a negation of a formula so a formula could be derived as a negation formula could be derived as a negation formula could be derived as a negation of another formula which could in turn of another formula which could in turn
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,8:15,8:29,of another formula which could in turn be derived as an implication now there be derived as an implication now there be derived as an implication now there are two formulae here in the implication are two formulae here in the implication are two formulae here in the implication there is an antecedent as well as a
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,8:29,8:41,there is an antecedent as well as a there is an antecedent as well as a consequence we could decide that the consequence we could decide that the consequence we could decide that the antecedent is a negation of another antecedent is a negation of another antecedent is a negation of another formula so now the synthesized formula
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,8:41,8:48,formula so now the synthesized formula formula so now the synthesized formula has two placeholders two instances of s has two placeholders two instances of s has two placeholders two instances of s h will stand for a formula now we could h will stand for a formula now we could
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,8:48,9:04,h will stand for a formula now we could decide that these two instances are in decide that these two instances are in decide that these two instances are in fact atomic formula and then we could fact atomic formula and then we could fact atomic formula and then we could say that the first atomic formula stands
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,9:04,9:15,say that the first atomic formula stands say that the first atomic formula stands for propositional symbol a and the for propositional symbol a and the for propositional symbol a and the second atomic formula stands for the second atomic formula stands for the second atomic formula stands for the propositional symbol a now this is a
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,9:15,9:33,propositional symbol a now this is a propositional symbol a now this is a concrete propositional formula this is concrete propositional formula this is concrete propositional formula this is what we call a wellformed formula this is a formula made up of the this is a formula made up of the alphabet of our language it has negation

204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,9:46,9:52,of the alphabet of our language so this is how we derive the formulae of the is how we derive the formulae of the is how we derive the formulae of the language using these two grammar rules language using these two grammar rules language using these two grammar rules we can derive the formulae of our
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,9:52,10:16,we can derive the formulae of our we can derive the formulae of our language so this is the syntax the language so this is the syntax the language so this is the syntax the syntax specifies what are the syntax specifies what are the syntax specifies what are the wellformed formula well form formal the
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,10:16,10:39,wellformed formula well form formal the wellformed formula well form formal the semantics of the proof system specifies what they mean what the specifies what they mean what the formula mean so now let us go on to the formula mean so now let us go on to the formula mean so now let us go on to the semantics of our proof system how do we
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,10:39,11:00,semantics of our proof system how do we semantics of our proof system how do we specify truth values for these formulae specify truth values for these formulae specify truth values for these formulae to specify the semantics we consider to specify the semantics we consider to specify the semantics we consider functions of this form functions that
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,11:00,11:16,functions of this form functions that functions of this form functions that map the propositional symbols or the map the propositional symbols or the map the propositional symbols or the atomic formula to the set zero and one atomic formula to the set zero and one atomic formula to the set zero and one such a function is called an assignment
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,11:16,11:34,so this is essentially an assignment of so this is essentially an assignment of truth values to the propositional truth values to the propositional truth values to the propositional symbols a propositional symbol is the same as an a propositional symbol is the same as an atomic formula atomic formula
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,11:34,11:48,atomic formula these two are synonyms so an assignment these two are synonyms so an assignment these two are synonyms so an assignment sigma at the act assigns truth values to sigma at the act assigns truth values to sigma at the act assigns truth values to the propositional symbols or the atomic
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,11:48,11:56,the propositional symbols or the atomic the propositional symbols or the atomic formula so now once we have an formula so now once we have an formula so now once we have an assignment we can say which atomic assignment we can say which atomic assignment we can say which atomic formula are to in which are to make
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,11:56,12:01,formula are to in which are to make formula are to in which are to make formulae are false but how do we know formulae are false but how do we know formulae are false but how do we know the truth values of a synthesized the truth values of a synthesized
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,12:01,12:14,the truth values of a synthesized formula now a wellformed formula so the formula now a wellformed formula so the formula now a wellformed formula so the semantics of a wellformed formula is semantics of a wellformed formula is semantics of a wellformed formula is denoted like this when i write like this
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,12:14,12:35,denoted like this when i write like this denoted like this when i write like this what i mean is the truth value of alpha what i mean is the truth value of alpha what i mean is the truth value of alpha under the assignment sigma so this is a notation we shall use so
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,12:35,12:47,so this is a notation we shall use so using this notation we say that for an using this notation we say that for an using this notation we say that for an atomic formula a in the truth value of atomic formula a in the truth value of atomic formula a in the truth value of the formula a n under the assignment
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,12:47,12:55,the formula a n under the assignment the formula a n under the assignment sigma is nothing but the truth value sigma is nothing but the truth value sigma is nothing but the truth value explicitly assigned by sigma to it so explicitly assigned by sigma to it so explicitly assigned by sigma to it so sigma is a mapping from the
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,12:55,13:01,sigma is a mapping from the sigma is a mapping from the propositional symbols to the truth propositional symbols to the truth propositional symbols to the truth values so the truth value which is values so the truth value which is values so the truth value which is mapped to a n will be the meaning of a
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,13:01,13:11,mapped to a n will be the meaning of a mapped to a n will be the meaning of a in so that specifies the truth values in so that specifies the truth values in so that specifies the truth values for all atomic propositions now let us for all atomic propositions now let us
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,13:11,13:23,for all atomic propositions now let us consider formally of this form formally consider formally of this form formally consider formally of this form formally that our negations the truth value that our negations the truth value that our negations the truth value assigned to the negation of a formula
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,13:23,13:34,assigned to the negation of a formula assigned to the negation of a formula will be defined in this manner you will be defined in this manner you will be defined in this manner you compute the truth value of the formula compute the truth value of the formula compute the truth value of the formula alpha under sigma and then subtract that
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,13:34,13:41,alpha under sigma and then subtract that alpha under sigma and then subtract that from this is the truth value that is from this is the truth value that is from this is the truth value that is assigned to the negation of alpha so if assigned to the negation of alpha so if
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,13:41,13:50,assigned to the negation of alpha so if alpha evaluates to under sigma then alpha evaluates to under sigma then alpha evaluates to under sigma then not of alpha will be assigned if alpha not of alpha will be assigned if alpha not of alpha will be assigned if alpha evaluates to under sigma then not of
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,13:50,14:01,evaluates to under sigma then not of evaluates to under sigma then not of alpha will be assigned a value of alpha will be assigned a value of alpha will be assigned a value of under sigma so this is how you assign a under sigma so this is how you assign a
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,14:01,14:18,under sigma so this is how you assign a truth value to a negation for an truth value to a negation for an truth value to a negation for an implication likewise we can say this is implication likewise we can say this is implication likewise we can say this is minus the meaning of alpha under sigma
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,14:18,14:32,minus the meaning of alpha under sigma minus the meaning of alpha under sigma multiplied by minus the meaning of multiplied by minus the meaning of multiplied by minus the meaning of beta under signal that is the truth value assigned to that is the truth value assigned to alpha implies beta under the assignment
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,14:32,14:38,alpha implies beta under the assignment alpha implies beta under the assignment sigma would be this quantity so you can sigma would be this quantity so you can sigma would be this quantity so you can see that this assigns a tooth value of see that this assigns a tooth value of
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,14:38,14:58,see that this assigns a tooth value of zero if and only if alpha evaluates to zero if and only if alpha evaluates to zero if and only if alpha evaluates to true and beta evaluates to false under true and beta evaluates to false under true and beta evaluates to false under sigma or in other words if alpha is zero
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,14:58,15:06,sigma or in other words if alpha is zero sigma or in other words if alpha is zero or beta is then alpha implies beta or beta is then alpha implies beta or beta is then alpha implies beta will be assigned a truth value of so will be assigned a truth value of so
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,15:06,15:13,will be assigned a truth value of so this is how we assign truth values to this is how we assign truth values to this is how we assign truth values to composite formulae so this now specifies composite formulae so this now specifies composite formulae so this now specifies a truth value for every single
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,15:13,15:19,a truth value for every single a truth value for every single wellformed formula so given a wellformed formula so given a wellformed formula so given a wellformed formula we can parse the wellformed formula we can parse the wellformed formula we can parse the formula see how the formula was derived
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,15:19,15:27,formula see how the formula was derived formula see how the formula was derived using the drama and then running along using the drama and then running along using the drama and then running along the derivation we can assign truth the derivation we can assign truth the derivation we can assign truth values to the constituents of the
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,15:27,15:39,values to the constituents of the values to the constituents of the formula so it is possible to calculate formula so it is possible to calculate formula so it is possible to calculate the truth value of a formula given an the truth value of a formula given an the truth value of a formula given an assignment so consider a tooth table for
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,15:39,15:50,assignment so consider a tooth table for assignment so consider a tooth table for a formula alpha in the truth table we a formula alpha in the truth table we a formula alpha in the truth table we find that we have one row corresponding find that we have one row corresponding
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,15:50,15:59,find that we have one row corresponding to each assignment so if the formula to each assignment so if the formula to each assignment so if the formula evaluates to under this assignment evaluates to under this assignment evaluates to under this assignment then the corresponding entry in the then the corresponding entry in the
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,15:59,16:08,then the corresponding entry in the truth table in the final column would be truth table in the final column would be truth table in the final column would be instead if the formula evaluates to instead if the formula evaluates to instead if the formula evaluates to then the corresponding entry will be
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,16:08,16:16,then the corresponding entry will be then the corresponding entry will be so looking at the truth table we can so looking at the truth table we can so looking at the truth table we can understand what the meaning of the understand what the meaning of the understand what the meaning of the formula is under any assignment so a
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,16:16,16:35,formula is under any assignment so a formula is under any assignment so a truth table is a complete specification truth table is a complete specification truth table is a complete specification of the semantics of a formula so given a formula alpha we can and as so given a formula alpha we can and as an assignment sigma we can refer to the
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,16:35,16:39,an assignment sigma we can refer to the an assignment sigma we can refer to the truth table to see whether sigma truth table to see whether sigma truth table to see whether sigma satisfies it or not once the truth table satisfies it or not once the truth table
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,16:39,16:56,satisfies it or not once the truth table is available we say that alpha logically is available we say that alpha logically is available we say that alpha logically implies beta which we denote in this implies beta which we denote in this implies beta which we denote in this fashion the double implication is
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,16:56,17:26,fashion the double implication is fashion the double implication is supposed to mean that alpha logically supposed to mean that alpha logically supposed to mean that alpha logically implies beta if every assignment that implies beta if every assignment that implies beta if every assignment that satisfies alpha also satisfies beta
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,17:26,17:33,that is when we say that alpha logically that is when we say that alpha logically implies beta in other words if you look implies beta in other words if you look implies beta in other words if you look at the truth table and the columns at the truth table and the columns
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,17:33,17:45,at the truth table and the columns corresponding to alpha and beta we find corresponding to alpha and beta we find corresponding to alpha and beta we find that whenever alpha is beta is also that whenever alpha is beta is also that whenever alpha is beta is also true but of course beta could be true
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,17:45,17:53,true but of course beta could be true true but of course beta could be true even when alpha is false in some even when alpha is false in some even when alpha is false in some assignments where alpha is false beta assignments where alpha is false beta assignments where alpha is false beta could be but what we know is that
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,17:53,17:57,could be but what we know is that could be but what we know is that whenever alpha is beta is true whenever alpha is beta is true whenever alpha is beta is true therefore we say that beta is a logical therefore we say that beta is a logical
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,17:57,18:07,therefore we say that beta is a logical consequence of alpha if alpha holds then consequence of alpha if alpha holds then consequence of alpha if alpha holds then beta has to necessarily hold so another beta has to necessarily hold so another beta has to necessarily hold so another way of saying us this beta is a logical
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,18:07,18:26,way of saying us this beta is a logical way of saying us this beta is a logical consequence of alpha we could write this way to to say that we could write this way to to say that beta is a logical consequence of alpha beta is a logical consequence of alpha
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,18:26,18:48,beta is a logical consequence of alpha and we say that a formula wellformed and we say that a formula wellformed and we say that a formula wellformed formula formula formula alpha is a tautology if the truth value alpha is a tautology if the truth value alpha is a tautology if the truth value of alpha in sigma is for all possible
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,18:48,18:55,of alpha in sigma is for all possible of alpha in sigma is for all possible assignments signal so a tautology is a assignments signal so a tautology is a assignments signal so a tautology is a formula which is true always in every formula which is true always in every
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,18:55,19:07,formula which is true always in every single assignment the formula happens to single assignment the formula happens to single assignment the formula happens to be true when we write like this what we be true when we write like this what we be true when we write like this what we mean is that alpha is a tautology alpha
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,19:07,19:13,mean is that alpha is a tautology alpha mean is that alpha is a tautology alpha is a logical consequence of nothing is a logical consequence of nothing is a logical consequence of nothing in other words alpha is true everywhere in other words alpha is true everywhere in other words alpha is true everywhere in which case we say that alpha is a
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,19:13,19:37,in which case we say that alpha is a in which case we say that alpha is a tautology so let us look at the theorem now which so let us look at the theorem now which we call theorem this says that if alpha is a logical consequence of a set
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,19:37,19:43,alpha is a logical consequence of a set of formally gamma gamma is a set of of formally gamma gamma is a set of of formally gamma gamma is a set of formula menu if alpha is a logical formula menu if alpha is a logical formula menu if alpha is a logical consequence of gamma in other words when

204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,19:49,20:15,each of these formulae is correct then each of these formulae is correct then alpha is also true and alpha implies alpha is also true and alpha implies alpha is also true and alpha implies beta is a logical consequence of gamma then beta is a logical consequence of then beta is a logical consequence of gamma so this is what we want to show
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,20:15,20:23,gamma so this is what we want to show gamma so this is what we want to show let us assume that alpha is a logical let us assume that alpha is a logical let us assume that alpha is a logical consequence of gamma and alpha implies consequence of gamma and alpha implies
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,20:23,20:30,consequence of gamma and alpha implies beta is a logical consequence of gamma beta is a logical consequence of gamma beta is a logical consequence of gamma so what it means is that in an so what it means is that in an so what it means is that in an assignment which satisfies the whole of
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,20:30,20:46,assignment which satisfies the whole of assignment which satisfies the whole of gamma alpha is true as well as alpha gamma alpha is true as well as alpha gamma alpha is true as well as alpha implies beta true so suppose sigma implies beta true so suppose sigma implies beta true so suppose sigma satisfies gamma
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,20:46,21:08,then sigma satisfies alpha and sigma then sigma satisfies alpha and sigma satisfies alpha implies bit so if under satisfies alpha implies bit so if under satisfies alpha implies bit so if under this assignment alpha is and alpha this assignment alpha is and alpha this assignment alpha is and alpha implies beta is true then beta must also
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,21:08,21:25,implies beta is true then beta must also implies beta is true then beta must also be true because if beta is not true then alpha because if beta is not true then alpha is and beta is false therefore alpha is and beta is false therefore alpha is and beta is false therefore alpha implies beta must be false which is a
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,21:25,21:39,implies beta must be false which is a implies beta must be false which is a contradiction therefore these two contradiction therefore these two contradiction therefore these two together ensures that beta is satisfied together ensures that beta is satisfied together ensures that beta is satisfied by gamma that proves the theorem so as a
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,21:39,21:51,by gamma that proves the theorem so as a by gamma that proves the theorem so as a corollary we see that if alpha is a corollary we see that if alpha is a corollary we see that if alpha is a tautology and alpha implies beta is also tautology and alpha implies beta is also
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,21:51,22:18,tautology and alpha implies beta is also a tautology then beta is also water toys now we have seen the syntax as well as now we have seen the syntax as well as the semantics of the system of logic how the semantics of the system of logic how the semantics of the system of logic how do we correlate the two how do you
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,22:18,22:30,do we correlate the two how do you do we correlate the two how do you distinguish a tautology when you see one that is one question when you have given that is one question when you have given a formula you have to say whether it is a formula you have to say whether it is
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,22:30,22:55,a formula you have to say whether it is a tautology or not the second question a tautology or not the second question a tautology or not the second question is this given gamma distinguish its is this given gamma distinguish its is this given gamma distinguish its logical consequences
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,22:55,23:01,so we have these two questions first we so we have these two questions first we want to distinguish tautologies given a want to distinguish tautologies given a want to distinguish tautologies given a formula we have to say whether it is a formula we have to say whether it is a
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,23:01,23:08,formula we have to say whether it is a tautology or not and secondly given tautology or not and secondly given tautology or not and secondly given gamma gamma could be finite or infinite gamma gamma could be finite or infinite gamma gamma could be finite or infinite we have to distinguish its logical
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,23:08,23:12,we have to distinguish its logical we have to distinguish its logical consequences that is given gamma in the consequences that is given gamma in the consequences that is given gamma in the context of gamma when we are given a context of gamma when we are given a context of gamma when we are given a formula alpha we have to say whether
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,23:12,23:20,formula alpha we have to say whether formula alpha we have to say whether alpha is a logical consequence of gamma alpha is a logical consequence of gamma alpha is a logical consequence of gamma or not if gamma is finite then these two or not if gamma is finite then these two
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,23:20,23:30,or not if gamma is finite then these two questions can be answered using the questions can be answered using the questions can be answered using the truth table method that is you drop the truth table method that is you drop the truth table method that is you drop the two table you have a formula alpha you
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,23:30,23:35,two table you have a formula alpha you two table you have a formula alpha you drop the truth table if the truth table drop the truth table if the truth table drop the truth table if the truth table says that the formula is true in every says that the formula is true in every
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,23:35,23:43,says that the formula is true in every single assignment then the formula is a single assignment then the formula is a single assignment then the formula is a tautology tautology tautology similarly you drop the tooth table for similarly you drop the tooth table for similarly you drop the tooth table for every single formula in gamma if gamma
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,23:43,23:47,every single formula in gamma if gamma every single formula in gamma if gamma is finite and then you also drop the is finite and then you also drop the is finite and then you also drop the truth table of alpha and you find that truth table of alpha and you find that
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,23:47,23:54,truth table of alpha and you find that in every assignment which satisfies the in every assignment which satisfies the in every assignment which satisfies the whole of gamma alpha is also true in whole of gamma alpha is also true in whole of gamma alpha is also true in which case alpha is a logical
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,23:54,24:01,which case alpha is a logical which case alpha is a logical consequence of gamma so the truth table consequence of gamma so the truth table consequence of gamma so the truth table method will help us in answering these method will help us in answering these method will help us in answering these questions in situations where gamma is
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,24:01,24:09,questions in situations where gamma is questions in situations where gamma is finite but the truth table method is a finite but the truth table method is a finite but the truth table method is a luxury that we have in the case of luxury that we have in the case of

204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,24:16,24:21,find that we do not have a method which find that we do not have a method which is analogues to the truth table method is analogues to the truth table method is analogues to the truth table method because the semantic space there could because the semantic space there could
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,24:21,24:32,because the semantic space there could be infinite therefore we need a be infinite therefore we need a be infinite therefore we need a different way of saying is different way of saying is different way of saying is distinguishing logical consequences as distinguishing logical consequences as distinguishing logical consequences as well as tautologies for this we have
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,24:32,25:02,well as tautologies for this we have well as tautologies for this we have what is called a proof system in a proof system we say that p is a in a proof system we say that p is a proof system if p has a set of axioms an
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,25:02,25:07,proof system if p has a set of axioms an proof system if p has a set of axioms an axiom is nothing but a formula from axiom is nothing but a formula from axiom is nothing but a formula from formula so a set of axioms is a set of
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,25:07,25:22,formula so a set of axioms is a set of formula so a set of axioms is a set of formulae and a set of rules of inference formulae and a set of rules of inference formulae and a set of rules of inference a rule of inference is a relation on
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,25:22,25:30,a rule of inference is a relation on a rule of inference is a relation on formulae so a proof system consists of formulae so a proof system consists of formulae so a proof system consists of these two components a set of axioms and these two components a set of axioms and
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,25:30,25:41,these two components a set of axioms and a set of rules of inference and then a a set of rules of inference and then a a set of rules of inference and then a proof in this proof system is a sequence proof in this proof system is a sequence
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,25:41,26:04,proof in this proof system is a sequence of formally a sequence beta through beta n is a sequence beta through beta n is called a proof where beta is an axiom called a proof where beta is an axiom called a proof where beta is an axiom so a proof always begins with an axiom
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,26:04,26:17,so a proof always begins with an axiom so a proof always begins with an axiom and beta i for i greater than is an and beta i for i greater than is an and beta i for i greater than is an axiom you could use an ask axiom
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,26:17,26:28,axiom you could use an ask axiom axiom you could use an ask axiom anywhere in the proof so beta i is anywhere in the proof so beta i is anywhere in the proof so beta i is either an axiom or follows from beta either an axiom or follows from beta
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,26:28,26:42,either an axiom or follows from beta through beta i minus the previous through beta i minus the previous through beta i minus the previous formula in the proof by some rule of formula in the proof by some rule of formula in the proof by some rule of inference
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,26:42,26:51,so this is our notion of a proof we have so this is our notion of a proof we have a set of axioms and we have a set of a set of axioms and we have a set of a set of axioms and we have a set of rules of inference a proof is a sequence
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,26:51,26:55,rules of inference a proof is a sequence rules of inference a proof is a sequence of formulae beta through beta and so of formulae beta through beta and so of formulae beta through beta and so that the first formula in the sequence that the first formula in the sequence
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,26:55,27:03,that the first formula in the sequence is necessarily an axiom and any is necessarily an axiom and any is necessarily an axiom and any subsequent formula in the proof itself subsequent formula in the proof itself subsequent formula in the proof itself is either an axiom or follows from the
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,27:03,27:08,is either an axiom or follows from the is either an axiom or follows from the previous formula in the proof by some previous formula in the proof by some previous formula in the proof by some rule of inference so what it means is rule of inference so what it means is
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,27:08,27:13,rule of inference so what it means is that within a proof you can use an axiom that within a proof you can use an axiom that within a proof you can use an axiom anywhere you want and at any point in anywhere you want and at any point in
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,27:13,27:20,anywhere you want and at any point in time you can use some of the previous time you can use some of the previous time you can use some of the previous formula combine them to using a rule of formula combine them to using a rule of formula combine them to using a rule of inference to create a new formula which
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,27:20,27:24,inference to create a new formula which inference to create a new formula which could be the next formula within the could be the next formula within the could be the next formula within the proof so such a sequence of formula is proof so such a sequence of formula is
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,27:24,27:51,proof so such a sequence of formula is called a proof so now let us see a proof called a proof so now let us see a proof called a proof so now let us see a proof system for propositional calculus a pro system p for propositional a pro system p for propositional calculus consists of some axioms that
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,27:51,28:05,calculus consists of some axioms that calculus consists of some axioms that are called logical axioms so axioms are called logical axioms so axioms are called logical axioms so axioms could be classified into logical axioms could be classified into logical axioms could be classified into logical axioms and proper axioms so the logical axioms
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,28:05,28:12,and proper axioms so the logical axioms and proper axioms so the logical axioms would belong to these templates so in would belong to these templates so in would belong to these templates so in this proof system that we are going to this proof system that we are going to
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,28:12,28:25,this proof system that we are going to talk about there are three templates talk about there are three templates talk about there are three templates these templates are these the first in these templates are these the first in these templates are these the first in template is of the form alpha implies
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,28:25,28:37,template is of the form alpha implies template is of the form alpha implies beta implies alpha this is the first beta implies alpha this is the first beta implies alpha this is the first template so from this template you can template so from this template you can template so from this template you can form concrete axioms by substituting
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,28:37,28:51,form concrete axioms by substituting form concrete axioms by substituting formula for alpha beta and alpha and formula for alpha beta and alpha and formula for alpha beta and alpha and beta in this case so you could write a beta in this case so you could write a beta in this case so you could write a implies a implies a a implies a
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,28:51,28:59,implies a implies a a implies a implies a implies a a implies a implies a and so on so these are all implies a and so on so these are all implies a and so on so these are all concrete formally that are derived using concrete formally that are derived using
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,28:59,29:16,concrete formally that are derived using this template therefore we will say that this template therefore we will say that this template therefore we will say that a is an axiom schema the second axiom or the second family of the second axiom or the second family of axioms of this form alpha implies beta

204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,30:00,30:13,an infinite number of logical axioms so an infinite number of logical axioms so p consists of an infinite number of p consists of an infinite number of p consists of an infinite number of logical axioms in addition to that we logical axioms in addition to that we logical axioms in addition to that we could also have coral proper axioms let
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,30:13,30:20,could also have coral proper axioms let could also have coral proper axioms let us say we have a set of proper axioms us say we have a set of proper axioms us say we have a set of proper axioms called gamma so this could be any set of
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,30:20,30:38,called gamma so this could be any set of called gamma so this could be any set of arbitrary formula that suits our arbitrary formula that suits our arbitrary formula that suits our convenience and we have only one rule of convenience and we have only one rule of convenience and we have only one rule of inference
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,30:38,30:57,this rule of inference is called modus this rule of inference is called modus ponens or mp for short it is triplets of ponens or mp for short it is triplets of ponens or mp for short it is triplets of this form alpha alpha implies beta and this form alpha alpha implies beta and
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,30:57,31:14,this form alpha alpha implies beta and beta where alpha and beta are well beta where alpha and beta are well beta where alpha and beta are well formed formula or we could write like formed formula or we could write like formed formula or we could write like this a rule of inference could be
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,31:14,31:23,this a rule of inference could be this a rule of inference could be written like this when you have alpha written like this when you have alpha written like this when you have alpha and alpha implies beta then beta is and alpha implies beta then beta is and alpha implies beta then beta is derive about so what it means is that
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,31:23,31:29,derive about so what it means is that derive about so what it means is that within a proof if you have already within a proof if you have already within a proof if you have already proved alpha and you have proved alpha proved alpha and you have proved alpha
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,31:29,31:40,proved alpha and you have proved alpha implies beta then as the next step in implies beta then as the next step in implies beta then as the next step in the proof you could write beta that is the proof you could write beta that is the proof you could write beta that is if alpha and alpha implies beta are

204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,31:46,31:51,proof could be beaten so this is a proof could be beaten so this is a rewriting rule called modus ponens so rewriting rule called modus ponens so rewriting rule called modus ponens so this is the only role of inference that this is the only role of inference that
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,31:51,32:10,this is the only role of inference that we have so in the sense our axioms are logical axioms or the fall formally the logical axioms or the fall formally the set of formulae in the set of formula set of formulae in the set of formula set of formulae in the set of formula gamma so axioms are from these and mp is
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,32:10,32:15,gamma so axioms are from these and mp is gamma so axioms are from these and mp is our only rule of inference therefore a our only rule of inference therefore a our only rule of inference therefore a proof will consist of a sequence beta proof will consist of a sequence beta

204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,32:39,32:47,formulae is what we call a proof so you formulae is what we call a proof so you may have noticed that here in our system may have noticed that here in our system may have noticed that here in our system we have only two logical connectives for we have only two logical connectives for
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,32:47,32:56,we have only two logical connectives for example we have negation and implication example we have negation and implication example we have negation and implication but but but having used any other connective that is having used any other connective that is having used any other connective that is because the set is a complete set of

204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,33:30,33:40,negation of negation of x is the same as x therefore negation of x implies y is x therefore negation of x implies y is x therefore negation of x implies y is nothing but the r of x and y that is or nothing but the r of x and y that is or
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,33:40,33:48,nothing but the r of x and y that is or can be synthesized using negation and can be synthesized using negation and can be synthesized using negation and implication now we know that or and not implication now we know that or and not implication now we know that or and not together form a complete set of
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,33:48,33:58,together form a complete set of together form a complete set of connectives therefore negation and connectives therefore negation and connectives therefore negation and implication also form a complete set of implication also form a complete set of implication also form a complete set of connectors therefore in our system if we
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,33:58,34:07,connectors therefore in our system if we connectors therefore in our system if we have only these two connectives still we have only these two connectives still we have only these two connectives still we can synthesize any boolean function as can synthesize any boolean function as can synthesize any boolean function as we have seen before so that is why we
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,34:07,34:30,we have seen before so that is why we we have seen before so that is why we have used only these two connectives in have used only these two connectives in have used only these two connectives in our system now let us see a sample proof when we write like this what we mean is
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,34:30,34:53,when we write like this what we mean is that alpha is provable from the logical that alpha is provable from the logical that alpha is provable from the logical axioms alone without any proper axioms when we write like this what we say is when we write like this what we say is that alpha is provable from gamma so in
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,34:53,34:58,that alpha is provable from gamma so in that alpha is provable from gamma so in this case what we mean is that from this case what we mean is that from this case what we mean is that from logical axioms and the set of proper logical axioms and the set of proper

204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,35:17,35:26,gamma so this is what we want to gamma so this is what we want to establish alpha implies alpha is establish alpha implies alpha is establish alpha implies alpha is provable from let us say nothing that is provable from let us say nothing that is provable from let us say nothing that is from logical axioms alone we can prove
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,35:26,35:33,from logical axioms alone we can prove from logical axioms alone we can prove alpha implies alpha so what how we prove alpha implies alpha so what how we prove alpha implies alpha so what how we prove is this the first statement has to be is this the first statement has to be
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,35:33,36:00,is this the first statement has to be necessarily an axiom so the axiom that necessarily an axiom so the axiom that necessarily an axiom so the axiom that we chooses this so this is the first statement in the so this is the first statement in the proof the first statement has to be
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,36:00,36:05,proof the first statement has to be proof the first statement has to be necessarily an axiom now is this an necessarily an axiom now is this an necessarily an axiom now is this an axiom we find that it is indeed an axiom axiom we find that it is indeed an axiom
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,36:05,36:15,axiom we find that it is indeed an axiom because this is from the second template because this is from the second template because this is from the second template in the second template we have alpha in the second template we have alpha in the second template we have alpha implies beta implies gamma implies alpha
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,36:15,36:22,implies beta implies gamma implies alpha implies beta implies gamma implies alpha implies beta implies alpha implies gamma implies beta implies alpha implies gamma implies beta implies alpha implies gamma so if you substitute alpha implies alpha so if you substitute alpha implies alpha so if you substitute alpha implies alpha for beta and alpha for gamma what we get
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,36:22,36:33,for beta and alpha for gamma what we get for beta and alpha for gamma what we get is exactly this so this is an instance is exactly this so this is an instance is exactly this so this is an instance of axiom schema by substituting alpha of axiom schema by substituting alpha
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,36:33,36:46,of axiom schema by substituting alpha implies alpha for beta and alpha for implies alpha for beta and alpha for implies alpha for beta and alpha for gamma this is what we get so this is the gamma this is what we get so this is the gamma this is what we get so this is the first statement in our proof the second

204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,37:27,37:41,implication and phi implies alpha implication and phi implies alpha implies alpha implies alpha implies implies alpha implies alpha implies implies alpha implies alpha implies informant how do we get this we get this from the how do we get this we get this from the first two statements so if you observe
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,37:41,37:49,first two statements so if you observe first two statements so if you observe the first two statements we find that the first two statements we find that the first two statements we find that the second statement is in fact the the second statement is in fact the the second statement is in fact the antecedent of the implication which is
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,37:49,37:58,antecedent of the implication which is antecedent of the implication which is the first statement the second statement the first statement the second statement the first statement the second statement and the antecedent here are identical and the antecedent here are identical and the antecedent here are identical therefore once we have these two
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,37:58,38:02,therefore once we have these two therefore once we have these two statements in our proof we can apply the statements in our proof we can apply the statements in our proof we can apply the rule of inference modus ponens on these rule of inference modus ponens on these
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,38:02,38:11,rule of inference modus ponens on these and we can write the consequent as the and we can write the consequent as the and we can write the consequent as the next statement that is precisely what we next statement that is precisely what we next statement that is precisely what we have done this happens to be the

204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,38:18,38:38,proof so this is by modus ponens on statements one and two and then we have statements one and two and then we have statements one and two and then we have alpha implies alpha implies alpha oh by alpha implies alpha implies alpha oh by alpha implies alpha implies alpha oh by a if in axiom schema you substitute
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,38:38,38:47,a if in axiom schema you substitute a if in axiom schema you substitute alpha for beta this is precisely what alpha for beta this is precisely what alpha for beta this is precisely what you get alpha implies alpha implies you get alpha implies alpha implies you get alpha implies alpha implies alpha so this is the fourth statement in
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,38:47,38:54,alpha so this is the fourth statement in alpha so this is the fourth statement in the proof now you compare the third the proof now you compare the third the proof now you compare the third statement with the fourth statement we statement with the fourth statement we statement with the fourth statement we find that the fourth statement is the
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,38:54,39:06,find that the fourth statement is the find that the fourth statement is the same as the antecedent of the third same as the antecedent of the third same as the antecedent of the third statement therefore we can now derive statement therefore we can now derive statement therefore we can now derive the consequent of the third statement as
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,39:06,39:13,the consequent of the third statement as the consequent of the third statement as the next statement in the proof and this the next statement in the proof and this the next statement in the proof and this is precisely what we wanted to prove we is precisely what we wanted to prove we
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,39:13,39:21,is precisely what we wanted to prove we wanted to show that alpha implies alpha wanted to show that alpha implies alpha wanted to show that alpha implies alpha is provable from logical axioms alone is provable from logical axioms alone is provable from logical axioms alone that is precisely what we have done so
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,39:21,39:31,that is precisely what we have done so that is precisely what we have done so this is an example of a proof in our this is an example of a proof in our this is an example of a proof in our system now we prove what is called the

204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,42:09,42:15,one of the three templates a one a two one of the three templates a one a two and a three and a three and a three if you look at a one a two and a three if you look at a one a two and a three if you look at a one a two and a three you find that these three templates are
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,42:15,42:21,you find that these three templates are you find that these three templates are essentially two tautologies that is essentially two tautologies that is essentially two tautologies that is whatever you substitute for the whatever you substitute for the whatever you substitute for the variables here what you get to set out
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,42:21,42:25,variables here what you get to set out variables here what you get to set out all it you can drop the truth table and all it you can drop the truth table and all it you can drop the truth table and see that if whatever truth values you

204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,45:31,45:36,implies beta i the two are symmetric so implies beta i the two are symmetric so we will discuss only one it is exactly we will discuss only one it is exactly we will discuss only one it is exactly in these two situations when we will be in these two situations when we will be
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,45:36,45:41,in these two situations when we will be able to derive beta i from beta j and able to derive beta i from beta j and able to derive beta i from beta j and beta k using modus ponens so let us beta k using modus ponens so let us
204.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,45:41,45:49,beta k using modus ponens so let us consider the first case let us assume consider the first case let us assume consider the first case let us assume that beta k is beta j implies beta i now that beta k is beta j implies beta i now that beta k is beta j implies beta i now what we know is that all the previous

205.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:17,3:28,included the existential qualifier that included the existential qualifier that is because existential quantification is because existential quantification is because existential quantification can be expressed using universal can be expressed using universal can be expressed using universal quantification and negation by de quantification and negation by de quantification and negation by de morgans law for example a formula of

205.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,7:10,7:24,quantification applied on a wellformed quantification applied on a wellformed formula will also be a wellformed formula will also be a wellformed formula will also be a wellformed formula so a wellformed formula can be formula so a wellformed formula can be formula so a wellformed formula can be synthesized in this fashion so these are
205.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,7:24,7:32,synthesized in this fashion so these are synthesized in this fashion so these are the rules governing the syntactic the rules governing the syntactic the rules governing the syntactic entities of firstorder logic entities of firstorder logic entities of firstorder logic evidence in tactic entity can be evidence in tactic entity can be
205.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,7:32,7:51,evidence in tactic entity can be generated using one of these rules from generated using one of these rules from generated using one of these rules from the alphabet now we need to specify the the alphabet now we need to specify the the alphabet now we need to specify the semantics
205.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,7:51,8:12,to specify the semantics of firstorder to specify the semantics of firstorder logic we use what is called an logic we use what is called an logic we use what is called an interpretation an interpretation i is a interpretation an interpretation i is a interpretation an interpretation i is a triplet it specifies d a domain of

205.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,45:27,45:50,quantification here so let us take an quantification here so let us take an example for this so first we said that t example for this so first we said that t example for this so first we said that t is free for x i in alpha if no variable
205.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,45:50,46:27,is free for x i in alpha if no variable is free for x i in alpha if no variable in t well be captured by a quantifier in well be captured by a quantifier in alpha when tea is substituted for free when tea is substituted for free occurrences of x i
205.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,46:27,46:54,as an example consider this suppose as an example consider this suppose alpha of x i is this formula for all x j alpha of x i is this formula for all x j alpha of x i is this formula for all x j x i is not older than x t so this
205.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,46:54,47:05,x i is not older than x t so this x i is not older than x t so this formula asserts that x i is not older formula asserts that x i is not older formula asserts that x i is not older than everybody so in that sense x i is
205.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,47:05,47:10,than everybody so in that sense x i is than everybody so in that sense x i is at least as young as anybody in the at least as young as anybody in the at least as young as anybody in the group that is what the statement asserts group that is what the statement asserts
205.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,47:10,47:34,group that is what the statement asserts now let us consider a term t which is now let us consider a term t which is now let us consider a term t which is father of xj when this term is substituted for every when this term is substituted for every free occurrence of this formula every
205.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,47:34,47:38,free occurrence of this formula every free occurrence of this formula every free occurrence of x i in this formula free occurrence of x i in this formula free occurrence of x i in this formula so in this formula there is a bound so in this formula there is a bound
205.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,47:38,47:44,so in this formula there is a bound occurrence of xj this is the bound occurrence of xj this is the bound occurrence of xj this is the bound occurrence of xj it is bound to this occurrence of xj it is bound to this occurrence of xj it is bound to this quantifier but this occurrence of x i is
205.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,47:44,47:52,quantifier but this occurrence of x i is quantifier but this occurrence of x i is free so we are planning to substitute t free so we are planning to substitute t free so we are planning to substitute t for every free occurrence of x i in this for every free occurrence of x i in this
205.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,47:52,48:01,for every free occurrence of x i in this formula we could write it this way t formula we could write it this way t formula we could write it this way t being substituted for every free being substituted for every free being substituted for every free occurrence of x i would give us this
205.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,48:01,48:19,occurrence of x i would give us this occurrence of x i would give us this formula for all xj father of xj is not formula for all xj father of xj is not formula for all xj father of xj is not older than xj which is a funny statement in the normal
205.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,48:19,48:33,which is a funny statement in the normal interpretation of this world but this interpretation of this world but this interpretation of this world but this was certainly not what was intended so was certainly not what was intended so was certainly not what was intended so if you were to substitute this term in a
205.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,48:33,48:38,if you were to substitute this term in a if you were to substitute this term in a formula we should make sure that no formula we should make sure that no formula we should make sure that no quantifier existing in that formula will quantifier existing in that formula will
205.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,48:38,48:45,quantifier existing in that formula will capture the free variable here so the capture the free variable here so the capture the free variable here so the substitution is happening in some substitution is happening in some substitution is happening in some contexts in which xj has some meaning xj
205.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,48:45,48:53,contexts in which xj has some meaning xj contexts in which xj has some meaning xj is mapped to some individual but then is mapped to some individual but then is mapped to some individual but then that is defined by the context and that is defined by the context and
205.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,48:53,49:00,that is defined by the context and therefore after the substitution also we therefore after the substitution also we therefore after the substitution also we should let the context define the should let the context define the should let the context define the meaning of this particular xj but when
205.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,49:00,49:09,meaning of this particular xj but when meaning of this particular xj but when that substitution happens here we find that substitution happens here we find that substitution happens here we find that this free occurrence of xj is being that this free occurrence of xj is being that this free occurrence of xj is being caught by the already existing
205.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,49:09,49:19,caught by the already existing caught by the already existing quantifier there so to avoid this quantifier there so to avoid this quantifier there so to avoid this pitfall what we should do is to change pitfall what we should do is to change pitfall what we should do is to change the variable name so this bound variable
205.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,49:19,49:29,the variable name so this bound variable the variable name so this bound variable xj can be changed to xj prime so once xj can be changed to xj prime so once xj can be changed to xj prime so once you do this then this association is not you do this then this association is not
205.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,49:29,49:35,you do this then this association is not made so what does it say now it says made so what does it say now it says made so what does it say now it says that father of xj is not older than that father of xj is not older than
205.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,49:35,49:43,that father of xj is not older than everybody so we might be considering a everybody so we might be considering a everybody so we might be considering a pool of others and what we are asserting pool of others and what we are asserting pool of others and what we are asserting is their father of xj is possibly the
205.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,49:43,49:48,is their father of xj is possibly the is their father of xj is possibly the youngest in this group is at least as youngest in this group is at least as youngest in this group is at least as young as anybody in this group that young as anybody in this group that
205.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,49:48,49:58,young as anybody in this group that meaning makes sense but then this meaning makes sense but then this meaning makes sense but then this requires a change of variable so what requires a change of variable so what requires a change of variable so what the axiom that we have seen asserts that
205.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,49:58,50:04,the axiom that we have seen asserts that the axiom that we have seen asserts that if alpha is true for everybody then if alpha is true for everybody then if alpha is true for everybody then alpha must be true for individuals to alpha must be true for individuals to
205.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,50:04,50:12,alpha must be true for individuals to any particular individuals so this any particular individuals so this any particular individuals so this allows for particular isolations when allows for particular isolations when allows for particular isolations when you have a statement which is you have a statement which is you have a statement which is universally quantified then you will be
205.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,50:12,50:21,universally quantified then you will be universally quantified then you will be able to particular eyes the statement able to particular eyes the statement able to particular eyes the statement for a certain individual drawn from the for a certain individual drawn from the for a certain individual drawn from the domain of discourse now we have two more
205.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,50:21,50:30,domain of discourse now we have two more domain of discourse now we have two more axioms axiom a v is a formula that we axioms axiom a v is a formula that we axioms axiom a v is a formula that we have seen before for all x i

205.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,50:56,51:12,axiom a then axiom a says alpha axiom a then axiom a says alpha implies for all x i alpha if x i is not implies for all x i alpha if x i is not implies for all x i alpha if x i is not free in alpha which allows for
205.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,51:12,51:32,free in alpha which allows for free in alpha which allows for generalizations of formulae so these generalizations of formulae so these generalizations of formulae so these axioms even through asics are axiom axioms even through asics are axiom axioms even through asics are axiom schemas they use variables alpha beta and gamma
205.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,51:32,51:38,they use variables alpha beta and gamma that stand for any well form formally so that stand for any well form formally so that stand for any well form formally so if you substitute appropriate well form if you substitute appropriate well form if you substitute appropriate well form formula

206.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,16:28,16:39,interpretation in mind so the first interpretation in mind so the first axiom says that equality is transitive axiom says that equality is transitive axiom says that equality is transitive the second axiom says that for every x the second axiom says that for every x the second axiom says that for every x and x if x equal to x then s of x
206.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,16:39,16:45,and x if x equal to x then s of x and x if x equal to x then s of x equal to s of x or in other words if equal to s of x or in other words if equal to s of x or in other words if x equal to x then x plus is the
206.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,16:45,16:52,x equal to x then x plus is the x equal to x then x plus is the same as x plus the third axiom says same as x plus the third axiom says same as x plus the third axiom says that is not the successor of any one

206.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,17:00,17:04,have the same successor then x equal have the same successor then x equal to x in other words if x plus to x in other words if x plus to x in other words if x plus equal to x plus then you again equal to x plus then you again
206.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,17:04,17:13,equal to x plus then you again calsters cancel from both sides and calsters cancel from both sides and calsters cancel from both sides and get x equal to x to the fifth axiom get x equal to x to the fifth axiom get x equal to x to the fifth axiom says that when is added to x we get
206.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,17:13,17:21,says that when is added to x we get says that when is added to x we get x that is is the identity of x that is is the identity of x that is is the identity of addition in the sixth axiom we say that addition in the sixth axiom we say that
206.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,17:21,17:28,addition in the sixth axiom we say that x added to the successor of x that x added to the successor of x that x added to the successor of x that is x plus x plus is the same as x is x plus x plus is the same as x
206.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,17:28,17:37,is x plus x plus is the same as x plus x plus so from this you can plus x plus so from this you can plus x plus so from this you can essentially derive the associativity of essentially derive the associativity of essentially derive the associativity of addition in the seventh axiom we have
206.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,17:37,17:49,addition in the seventh axiom we have addition in the seventh axiom we have multiplication with we know the of multiplication with we know the of multiplication with we know the of multiplication that is x into z is z multiplication that is x into z is z multiplication that is x into z is z in the eighth axiom we have distributive
206.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,17:49,17:57,in the eighth axiom we have distributive in the eighth axiom we have distributive ti x multiplied by x plus is the ti x multiplied by x plus is the ti x multiplied by x plus is the same as x x same as x x same as x x x so from this we can derive the
206.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,17:57,18:02,x so from this we can derive the x so from this we can derive the general form of distributivity and the general form of distributivity and the general form of distributivity and the ninth axiom is in fact the principle of ninth axiom is in fact the principle of
206.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,18:02,18:14,ninth axiom is in fact the principle of induction for any well formed formula induction for any well formed formula induction for any well formed formula alpha of x if you can show that alpha is alpha of x if you can show that alpha is alpha of x if you can show that alpha is true for zero and also that for any x if
206.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,18:14,18:19,true for zero and also that for any x if true for zero and also that for any x if alpha is true for x then alpha is true alpha is true for x then alpha is true alpha is true for x then alpha is true for x plus one if both of these can be
206.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,18:19,18:25,for x plus one if both of these can be for x plus one if both of these can be shown then we can argue that alpha is shown then we can argue that alpha is shown then we can argue that alpha is true for every x so this is the
206.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,18:25,18:35,true for every x so this is the true for every x so this is the principle of induction principle of induction principle of induction so all these axiom put together form our so all these axiom put together form our so all these axiom put together form our set gamma so gamma is called pianos

206.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,31:40,31:46,entity for example we can assign a entity for example we can assign a symbol a number for the opening bracket symbol a number for the opening bracket symbol a number for the opening bracket let us say for the closing bracket we let us say for the closing bracket we
206.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,31:46,31:54,let us say for the closing bracket we can assign a number and so on and can assign a number and so on and can assign a number and so on and then combining these we can assign a then combining these we can assign a then combining these we can assign a number we can find a way of encoding
206.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,31:54,31:59,number we can find a way of encoding number we can find a way of encoding every syntactic entity into a number for every syntactic entity into a number for every syntactic entity into a number for example when i have a statement of this example when i have a statement of this
206.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,31:59,32:11,example when i have a statement of this form the corresponding number for this form the corresponding number for this form the corresponding number for this could be the number corresponding to the could be the number corresponding to the could be the number corresponding to the opening bracket multiplied by the number
206.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,32:11,32:22,opening bracket multiplied by the number opening bracket multiplied by the number corresponding to a multiplied by the corresponding to a multiplied by the corresponding to a multiplied by the number corresponding to implication and number corresponding to implication and number corresponding to implication and so on this is one way of encoding and
206.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,32:22,32:28,so on this is one way of encoding and so on this is one way of encoding and this encoding has the property that we this encoding has the property that we this encoding has the property that we can uniquely decode any such given can uniquely decode any such given
206.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,32:28,32:35,can uniquely decode any such given number so yodel demonstrated that such number so yodel demonstrated that such number so yodel demonstrated that such an encoding is possible for the an encoding is possible for the an encoding is possible for the syntactic entities these are called syntactic entities these are called
206.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,32:35,32:52,syntactic entities these are called yodel numbering once the syntactic entities are encoded once the syntactic entities are encoded into numbers you can treat numbers as into numbers you can treat numbers as into numbers you can treat numbers as syntactic entities and then when you syntactic entities and then when you
206.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,32:52,33:02,syntactic entities and then when you look at the statements within the system look at the statements within the system look at the statements within the system we find that we have wellformed formula we find that we have wellformed formula we find that we have wellformed formula with free variables in particular if i
206.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,33:02,33:06,with free variables in particular if i with free variables in particular if i look at a wellformed formula alpha with look at a wellformed formula alpha with look at a wellformed formula alpha with one free variable x it seems to be one free variable x it seems to be
206.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,33:06,33:19,one free variable x it seems to be saying something about x the statement saying something about x the statement saying something about x the statement would be something like this x plus would be something like this x plus would be something like this x plus equal to so this is a formula with one
206.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,33:19,33:34,equal to so this is a formula with one equal to so this is a formula with one free variable x by substituting for x i free variable x by substituting for x i free variable x by substituting for x i can get various formulae some of them are true some of them are
206.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,33:34,33:44,some of them are true some of them are false and so on so those are familiar false and so on so those are familiar false and so on so those are familiar with one free variables but then family with one free variables but then family with one free variables but then family with one free variables now can also be
206.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,33:44,33:52,with one free variables now can also be with one free variables now can also be thought of as speaking about syntactic thought of as speaking about syntactic thought of as speaking about syntactic entities because now we have mapped entities because now we have mapped entities because now we have mapped syntactic entities and the numbers in a
206.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,33:52,33:59,syntactic entities and the numbers in a syntactic entities and the numbers in a onetoone manner therefore at least onetoone manner therefore at least onetoone manner therefore at least some of the numbers represent valid some of the numbers represent valid some of the numbers represent valid syntactic entities so a formula with one
206.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,33:59,34:05,syntactic entities so a formula with one syntactic entities so a formula with one free variable can be thought of as free variable can be thought of as free variable can be thought of as talking about a particular number but a talking about a particular number but a talking about a particular number but a number can be thought of as a syntactic
206.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,34:05,34:27,number can be thought of as a syntactic number can be thought of as a syntactic entity as well so now we have formally entity as well so now we have formally entity as well so now we have formally talking about syntactic entities but what are syntactic entities the
206.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,34:27,34:35,but what are syntactic entities the symbols are syntactic entities the symbols are syntactic entities the symbols are syntactic entities the function symbols predicate symbols open function symbols predicate symbols open function symbols predicate symbols open closed brackets implication negation all closed brackets implication negation all closed brackets implication negation all these are syntactic entities and then
206.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,34:35,34:40,these are syntactic entities and then these are syntactic entities and then well formed formulae are syntactic well formed formulae are syntactic well formed formulae are syntactic entities terms of syntactic entities entities terms of syntactic entities entities terms of syntactic entities which form constituents of wellformed which form constituents of wellformed
206.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,34:40,34:50,which form constituents of wellformed formally and we can also consider proofs formally and we can also consider proofs formally and we can also consider proofs as syntactic entities a proof is nothing as syntactic entities a proof is nothing as syntactic entities a proof is nothing but a sequence of formally so if you
206.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,34:50,34:56,but a sequence of formally so if you but a sequence of formally so if you combine the yodel numbers of the well combine the yodel numbers of the well combine the yodel numbers of the well form formerly belonging to a proof in an form formerly belonging to a proof in an
206.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,34:56,35:03,form formerly belonging to a proof in an appropriate manner we can also get appropriate manner we can also get appropriate manner we can also get device a girdle number for a proof so device a girdle number for a proof so device a girdle number for a proof so proofs are also syntactic entities now
206.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,35:03,35:13,proofs are also syntactic entities now proofs are also syntactic entities now yodel numbering maps all of these into yodel numbering maps all of these into yodel numbering maps all of these into the set of natural numbers in a the set of natural numbers in a the set of natural numbers in a onetoone manner therefore we can now
206.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,35:13,35:23,onetoone manner therefore we can now onetoone manner therefore we can now have statements that are talking about have statements that are talking about have statements that are talking about syntactic entities which include symbols syntactic entities which include symbols syntactic entities which include symbols well form formulae terms proofs etc
206.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,35:23,35:33,well form formulae terms proofs etc well form formulae terms proofs etc therefore we can have statements that therefore we can have statements that therefore we can have statements that are talking about probability roughly are talking about probability roughly are talking about probability roughly when you have a statement which says

207.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:52,3:04,the empty set an empty set is denoted by phi note that phi is not the same as the phi note that phi is not the same as the phi note that phi is not the same as the set containing phi a set with exactly set containing phi a set with exactly
207.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:04,3:14,set containing phi a set with exactly one member is called a singleton set so one member is called a singleton set so one member is called a singleton set so here phi is not the same as the here phi is not the same as the here phi is not the same as the singleton containing phi because phi has
207.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:14,3:20,singleton containing phi because phi has singleton containing phi because phi has no member its an empty set the no member its an empty set the no member its an empty set the singleton containing phi has one member singleton containing phi has one member singleton containing phi has one member namely phi itself so these two are not
207.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:20,3:36,namely phi itself so these two are not namely phi itself so these two are not the same if every member of a is a the same if every member of a is a the same if every member of a is a member of b as well for sets a and b we
207.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:36,3:53,member of b as well for sets a and b we member of b as well for sets a and b we say that a is a subset of b this symbol say that a is a subset of b this symbol say that a is a subset of b this symbol says is a subset or equal to b if a is a
207.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:53,4:02,says is a subset or equal to b if a is a says is a subset or equal to b if a is a subset of b and is not equal to b then subset of b and is not equal to b then subset of b and is not equal to b then we say that a is a proper subset of b
207.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:02,4:12,we say that a is a proper subset of b we say that a is a proper subset of b and it is denoted like this either like and it is denoted like this either like and it is denoted like this either like this or sometimes we write like this to
207.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:12,4:17,this or sometimes we write like this to this or sometimes we write like this to indicate that a is a subset of b but a indicate that a is a subset of b but a indicate that a is a subset of b but a is not equal to b so these two notations
207.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:17,4:25,is not equal to b so these two notations is not equal to b so these two notations use will be used interchangeably both use will be used interchangeably both use will be used interchangeably both mean to say that a is a proper subset of mean to say that a is a proper subset of
207.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:25,4:49,mean to say that a is a proper subset of b now let us define some operations on now let us define some operations on sets the union operation you denoted sets the union operation you denoted sets the union operation you denoted using this symbol is defined like this x

207.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:04,5:24,belongs to a or x belongs to b another belongs to a or x belongs to b another operation is the intersection operation just express using this symbol we say just express using this symbol we say that x belongs to a intersection b if that x belongs to a intersection b if
207.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:24,5:36,that x belongs to a intersection b if and only if it belongs to a and x and only if it belongs to a and x and only if it belongs to a and x belongs to b notice the correlation belongs to b notice the correlation belongs to b notice the correlation between the union symbol and the r
207.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:36,5:45,between the union symbol and the r between the union symbol and the r symbol the intersection symbol and the symbol the intersection symbol and the symbol the intersection symbol and the and symbol x belongs to a union b if and and symbol x belongs to a union b if and
207.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:45,5:50,and symbol x belongs to a union b if and only if x belongs to a or x belongs to b only if x belongs to a or x belongs to b only if x belongs to a or x belongs to b x belongs to a intersection b if and

207.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,6:02,6:21,the third operation is the relative complement complement of a with respect complement complement of a with respect complement complement of a with respect to a universal set a its defined like to a universal set a its defined like to a universal set a its defined like this x belongs to the complement of a
207.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,6:21,6:28,this x belongs to the complement of a this x belongs to the complement of a with respect to you if and only if x with respect to you if and only if x with respect to you if and only if x belongs to you and x does not belong to
207.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,6:28,6:53,belongs to you and x does not belong to belongs to you and x does not belong to it a set a can be deemed a predicate on it a set a can be deemed a predicate on it a set a can be deemed a predicate on objects for example consider firstorder
207.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,6:53,7:04,for example consider firstorder predicate or any logical predicate with predicate or any logical predicate with predicate or any logical predicate with one free variable so this statement is one free variable so this statement is one free variable so this statement is essentially a statement about one essentially a statement about one
207.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,7:04,7:10,essentially a statement about one unknown entity x is the one unknown unknown entity x is the one unknown unknown entity x is the one unknown entity for example it could be a entity for example it could be a entity for example it could be a statement of this form x greater than
207.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,7:10,7:16,statement of this form x greater than statement of this form x greater than five that is one free variable in this five that is one free variable in this five that is one free variable in this so you can assume that this is actually so you can assume that this is actually
207.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,7:16,7:27,so you can assume that this is actually a definition of a state it is talking a definition of a state it is talking a definition of a state it is talking about all individuals that are greater about all individuals that are greater about all individuals that are greater than five we write like this so using
207.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,7:27,7:35,than five we write like this so using than five we write like this so using every one variable predicate we can every one variable predicate we can every one variable predicate we can construct a set in other words a set can construct a set in other words a set can
207.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,7:35,7:43,construct a set in other words a set can be equated to a predicate on objects so be equated to a predicate on objects so be equated to a predicate on objects so let us say we have a universal set u and let us say we have a universal set u and
207.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,7:43,8:11,let us say we have a universal set u and we deal with subsets of u and we have these three operations union and we have these three operations union intersection and the relative complement the algebra defined by these three the algebra defined by these three operations you can see is in fact a

207.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,9:02,9:22,means u is the identity of intersection and the empty set is the identity of and the empty set is the identity of and the empty set is the identity of union then we have domination loss domination law says that the universal domination law says that the universal set u dominates the operation of union
207.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,9:22,9:30,set u dominates the operation of union set u dominates the operation of union thats because a union u is you for nea thats because a union u is you for nea thats because a union u is you for nea and the empty set dominates the and the empty set dominates the

207.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,15:25,15:43,of all subsets of a is denoted by two power a or sometimes p of a if a is a power a or sometimes p of a if a is a power a or sometimes p of a if a is a finite set the size of to power a to power the size
207.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,15:43,15:49,the size of to power a to power the size of a in other words if a has n members of a in other words if a has n members of a in other words if a has n members then the power set of a has power n then the power set of a has power n
207.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,15:49,16:03,then the power set of a has power n members the argument goes like this if the cardinality of n s is n the the cardinality of n s is n the cardinality of a set is the number of cardinality of a set is the number of cardinality of a set is the number of elements in the set when the set is
207.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,16:03,16:19,elements in the set when the set is elements in the set when the set is finite if the cardinality of a is n then finite if the cardinality of a is n then finite if the cardinality of a is n then to form a subset of a for each element
207.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,16:19,16:37,to form a subset of a for each element to form a subset of a for each element of a we have two choices pick the element or do not pick the pick the element or do not pick the element therefore there are power n element therefore there are power n
207.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,16:37,16:56,element therefore there are power n ways to form a subset let us if x through xn are the members of a for x through xn are the members of a for each element either i can pick it or each element either i can pick it or each element either i can pick it or leave it
207.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,16:56,17:04,leave it leave it select it or leave it for each of the n select it or leave it for each of the n select it or leave it for each of the n elements so there are two choices for elements so there are two choices for elements so there are two choices for each element therefore the total number
207.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,17:04,17:11,each element therefore the total number each element therefore the total number of ways in which you can form the subset of ways in which you can form the subset of ways in which you can form the subset is a multiple of n which is bar n is a multiple of n which is bar n
207.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,17:11,17:25,is a multiple of n which is bar n therefore the number of subsets of a is therefore the number of subsets of a is therefore the number of subsets of a is power n a set may contain sets so as power n a set may contain sets so as
207.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,17:25,17:53,power n a set may contain sets so as we have seen the power set we define the union of a in this manner we define the union of a in this manner it is a set of all x such that the rex it is a set of all x such that the rex
207.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,17:53,18:07,it is a set of all x such that the rex is b where b belongs to a and x belongs is b where b belongs to a and x belongs is b where b belongs to a and x belongs to b in other words union of a is the
207.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,18:07,18:24,to b in other words union of a is the to b in other words union of a is the set of members of members of a if b is a set of members of members of a if b is a set of members of members of a if b is a member of a and x happens to be a member
207.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,18:24,18:31,member of a and x happens to be a member member of a and x happens to be a member of b then x belongs to union of a of b then x belongs to union of a of b then x belongs to union of a analogously we can define intersection
207.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,18:31,18:48,analogously we can define intersection analogously we can define intersection of a as x such that for every b if b of a as x such that for every b if b of a as x such that for every b if b belongs to a then x belongs to b so
207.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,18:48,18:53,belongs to a then x belongs to b so belongs to a then x belongs to b so intersection of a is the set of those intersection of a is the set of those intersection of a is the set of those elements which belong to every member of elements which belong to every member of
207.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,18:53,19:12,elements which belong to every member of a for example of a is made up of these elements set a to free made up of these elements set a to free number four and the single ton number four and the single ton number four and the single ton containing just five then union of a
207.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,19:12,19:19,containing just five then union of a containing just five then union of a would be the set of all members of would be the set of all members of would be the set of all members of members of a number four is not a set members of a number four is not a set
207.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,19:19,19:26,members of a number four is not a set therefore it doesnt have members but therefore it doesnt have members but therefore it doesnt have members but set to three has two members namely to set to three has two members namely to set to three has two members namely to entry set five has one member namely
207.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,19:26,19:35,entry set five has one member namely entry set five has one member namely five so union of a is two three five five so union of a is two three five five so union of a is two three five intersection of a is the set of those intersection of a is the set of those
207.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,19:35,19:47,intersection of a is the set of those elements that belong to every member of elements that belong to every member of elements that belong to every member of a but since for us not a set it doesnt a but since for us not a set it doesnt a but since for us not a set it doesnt have any member therefore there is no

208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,14:56,15:02,piano system deals with arithmetic we piano system deals with arithmetic we have already seen pianos axioms and the have already seen pianos axioms and the have already seen pianos axioms and the module on logic so let us see how to module on logic so let us see how to
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,15:02,15:33,module on logic so let us see how to embed piano system in set theory first embed piano system in set theory first embed piano system in set theory first of all for a set a the successor of a denoted a superscript plus is defined as denoted a superscript plus is defined as a union the singleton set containing a
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,15:33,15:38,a union the singleton set containing a a union the singleton set containing a that is when you take a set and add it that is when you take a set and add it that is when you take a set and add it to itself we get the successor of the
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,15:38,15:48,to itself we get the successor of the to itself we get the successor of the set so this is how the successor of a set so this is how the successor of a set so this is how the successor of a set is defined and then we say a set a
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,15:48,16:13,set is defined and then we say a set a set is defined and then we say a set a is inductive the empty set belongs to a and for every the empty set belongs to a and for every a it belongs to a implies that the a it belongs to a implies that the
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,16:13,16:28,a it belongs to a implies that the successor of small a also belongs to a for every small a small a belongs to for every small a small a belongs to capital a implies that a plus also capital a implies that a plus also capital a implies that a plus also belongs to capital a that is the
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,16:28,16:37,belongs to capital a that is the belongs to capital a that is the successor of small a also belongs to successor of small a also belongs to successor of small a also belongs to capital a in other words a is closed capital a in other words a is closed
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,16:37,16:53,capital a in other words a is closed under the successor operate so for asset a to be inductive it should so for asset a to be inductive it should contain the empty set and for any set contain the empty set and for any set contain the empty set and for any set belonging to a it should also contain
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,16:53,16:58,belonging to a it should also contain belonging to a it should also contain the successor of that set that is the the successor of that set that is the the successor of that set that is the set should be closed under the success set should be closed under the success
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,16:58,17:07,set should be closed under the success of operator that is when we say that the of operator that is when we say that the of operator that is when we say that the set is inductive now let us define omega set is inductive now let us define omega
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,17:07,17:26,set is inductive now let us define omega as the intersection of all assets that as the intersection of all assets that as the intersection of all assets that is inductive we define omega as this is inductive we define omega as this is inductive we define omega as this intersection of all inductive sets that
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,17:26,17:46,intersection of all inductive sets that intersection of all inductive sets that is x belongs to omega if and only if x is x belongs to omega if and only if x is x belongs to omega if and only if x belongs to every inductive set which is precisely when x belongs to the
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,17:46,18:07,which is precisely when x belongs to the intersection of all inductive sets so the definition says that x belongs to so the definition says that x belongs to omega precisely when x belongs to every omega precisely when x belongs to every omega precisely when x belongs to every single inductive set now let us consider
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,18:07,18:25,single inductive set now let us consider single inductive set now let us consider some interesting properties of omega some interesting properties of omega some interesting properties of omega first of all omega is a subset of every first of all omega is a subset of every first of all omega is a subset of every inductive set that should be obvious
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,18:25,18:31,inductive set that should be obvious inductive set that should be obvious because in the previous slide we have because in the previous slide we have because in the previous slide we have just seen that if x belongs to omega just seen that if x belongs to omega just seen that if x belongs to omega then x belongs to every single of
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,18:31,18:41,then x belongs to every single of then x belongs to every single of inductive set therefore omega is a inductive set therefore omega is a inductive set therefore omega is a subset of every single inductive set subset of every single inductive set subset of every single inductive set that is the members of omega are members
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,18:41,19:01,that is the members of omega are members that is the members of omega are members of every single inductive set and then of every single inductive set and then of every single inductive set and then omega is inductive as well why should this be so this was because
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,19:01,19:16,why should this be so this was because fie belongs to a if is inductive for fie belongs to a if is inductive for fie belongs to a if is inductive for every a that is inductive if i belongs every a that is inductive if i belongs every a that is inductive if i belongs to a therefore i belongs to omega as
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,19:16,19:21,to a therefore i belongs to omega as to a therefore i belongs to omega as well because omega is the intersection well because omega is the intersection well because omega is the intersection of every single inductive set so if v of every single inductive set so if v
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,19:21,19:30,of every single inductive set so if v belongs to every single inductive set it belongs to every single inductive set it belongs to every single inductive set it should also belong to omega so that is should also belong to omega so that is should also belong to omega so that is the first requirement for omega to be
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,19:30,19:40,the first requirement for omega to be the first requirement for omega to be inductive it should contain the empty inductive it should contain the empty inductive it should contain the empty set so it indeed does contain the empty set so it indeed does contain the empty set so it indeed does contain the empty set now consider some x belonging to
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,19:40,19:58,set now consider some x belonging to set now consider some x belonging to omega then x belongs to every inductive omega then x belongs to every inductive omega then x belongs to every inductive set but then all inductive sets are closed but then all inductive sets are closed under the successor operator which means
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,19:58,20:06,under the successor operator which means under the successor operator which means x plus belongs to every inductive set in x plus belongs to every inductive set in x plus belongs to every inductive set in other words x plus belongs to the other words x plus belongs to the
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,20:06,20:16,other words x plus belongs to the intersection of all inductive sets which intersection of all inductive sets which intersection of all inductive sets which is precisely what omega is which means x is precisely what omega is which means x is precisely what omega is which means x plus belongs to omega so what we have is
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,20:16,20:23,plus belongs to omega so what we have is plus belongs to omega so what we have is this if x belongs to omega then x plus this if x belongs to omega then x plus this if x belongs to omega then x plus also belongs to omega which means omega
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,20:23,20:39,also belongs to omega which means omega also belongs to omega which means omega is closed under the successor operator that is the second requirement for omega that is the second requirement for omega to be inductive the first requirement is to be inductive the first requirement is to be inductive the first requirement is that omega should contain the empty set
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,20:39,20:45,that omega should contain the empty set that omega should contain the empty set the second requirement is it should be the second requirement is it should be the second requirement is it should be closed under the successor operator closed under the successor operator closed under the successor operator since we have established both we know
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,20:45,20:59,since we have established both we know since we have established both we know that omega is inductive so omega which that omega is inductive so omega which that omega is inductive so omega which is defined as the intersection of all is defined as the intersection of all is defined as the intersection of all inductive sets is itself an inductive
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,20:59,21:05,inductive sets is itself an inductive inductive sets is itself an inductive set and once again an inductive set is a set and once again an inductive set is a set and once again an inductive set is a set which contains an empty set and is set which contains an empty set and is
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,21:05,21:31,set which contains an empty set and is closed under the successor operator suppose x is a subset of omega and suppose x is a subset of omega and suppose x is inductive but then omega is a subset of every but then omega is a subset of every inductive circle therefore omega is a
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,21:31,21:37,inductive circle therefore omega is a inductive circle therefore omega is a subset of excess one but since x is a subset of excess one but since x is a subset of excess one but since x is a subset of omega this implies that omega subset of omega this implies that omega
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,21:37,21:44,subset of omega this implies that omega equal to x what it means is that if x is equal to x what it means is that if x is equal to x what it means is that if x is a subset of omega and x is inductive a subset of omega and x is inductive
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,21:44,21:56,a subset of omega and x is inductive then x has to be the same as omega or in then x has to be the same as omega or in then x has to be the same as omega or in other words no proper subset of omega is other words no proper subset of omega is
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,21:56,22:07,other words no proper subset of omega is inductive so combine this with the inductive so combine this with the inductive so combine this with the definition of omega omega is the definition of omega omega is the definition of omega omega is the intersection of every inductive set and
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,22:07,22:13,intersection of every inductive set and intersection of every inductive set and omega is a subset of every inductive set omega is a subset of every inductive set omega is a subset of every inductive set and no proper subset of omega is and no proper subset of omega is
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,22:13,22:31,and no proper subset of omega is inductive so in that sense omega is the inductive so in that sense omega is the inductive so in that sense omega is the smallest inductive set every inductive smallest inductive set every inductive smallest inductive set every inductive set is a superset of omega now using
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,22:31,22:40,set is a superset of omega now using set is a superset of omega now using this omega we can embed natural numbers this omega we can embed natural numbers this omega we can embed natural numbers in set theory so what we do is this we in set theory so what we do is this we
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,22:40,22:48,in set theory so what we do is this we define natural numbers in this manner we define natural numbers in this manner we define natural numbers in this manner we construct natural numbers in this manner construct natural numbers in this manner construct natural numbers in this manner we define as the empty set we define
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,22:48,23:22,we define as the empty set we define we define as the empty set we define as plus which is the successor of zero which is zero the successor of zero which is zero added to itself which is the successor of zero which which is the successor of zero which would be fight thats because this is
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,23:22,23:32,would be fight thats because this is would be fight thats because this is phi union the singleton fight so one is phi union the singleton fight so one is phi union the singleton fight so one is the singleton containing fight and then the singleton containing fight and then
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,23:32,24:02,the singleton containing fight and then two is the successor of which would be phi union the singleton which contains phi union the singleton which contains the singleton fight this would be the set containing two elements one is the set containing two elements one is phi and the other is a single term
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,24:02,24:09,phi and the other is a single term phi and the other is a single term containing fighting this is what is containing fighting this is what is containing fighting this is what is defined as two and then the number three defined as two and then the number three
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,24:09,24:18,defined as two and then the number three is defined as the successor of two the is defined as the successor of two the is defined as the successor of two the number four is defined as the successor number four is defined as the successor number four is defined as the successor of three and so on so in this manner we
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,24:18,24:24,of three and so on so in this manner we of three and so on so in this manner we define all the natural numbers so you define all the natural numbers so you define all the natural numbers so you can readily verify that zero is a member can readily verify that zero is a member
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,24:24,24:31,can readily verify that zero is a member of one which is a member of two which is of one which is a member of two which is of one which is a member of two which is a member of three and so on not just a member of three and so on not just
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,24:31,24:38,a member of three and so on not just that zero is a subset of one which is a that zero is a subset of one which is a that zero is a subset of one which is a subset of two which is a subset of three subset of two which is a subset of three
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,24:38,24:54,subset of two which is a subset of three subsets of four and so on subsets of four and so on subsets of four and so on so both these changes of relations hold so we have in the sense defined omega as so we have in the sense defined omega as the set of all natural numbers omega is
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,24:54,25:08,the set of all natural numbers omega is the set of all natural numbers omega is the set of all natural numbers that is the set of all natural numbers that is the set of all natural numbers that is because omega contains zero because omega contains zero because omega contains zero it contains the successor of which is
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,25:08,25:14,it contains the successor of which is it contains the successor of which is it contains the successor of which it contains the successor of which it contains the successor of which is and so on for every set it also is and so on for every set it also
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,25:14,25:21,is and so on for every set it also contains the successor of that set its contains the successor of that set its contains the successor of that set its closed under the successor operator so closed under the successor operator so closed under the successor operator so we define omega as the set of all
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,25:21,25:31,we define omega as the set of all we define omega as the set of all natural numbers and then you would natural numbers and then you would natural numbers and then you would recall pianos axioms that we saw in the recall pianos axioms that we saw in the
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,25:31,25:45,recall pianos axioms that we saw in the module on logic we define addition in module on logic we define addition in module on logic we define addition in this manner a plus is a and a plus the this manner a plus is a and a plus the this manner a plus is a and a plus the successor of b is the successor of a
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,25:45,26:07,successor of b is the successor of a successor of b is the successor of a plus b the duplication has defined us a into the duplication has defined us a into is and a into the successor of b is a is and a into the successor of b is a
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,26:07,26:18,is and a into the successor of b is a into b plus a so multiplication is into b plus a so multiplication is into b plus a so multiplication is defined using addition and radition is defined using addition and radition is defined using addition and radition is defined using the successor function so
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,26:18,26:25,defined using the successor function so defined using the successor function so in this manner we can construct natural in this manner we can construct natural in this manner we can construct natural numbers and the two operations addition numbers and the two operations addition numbers and the two operations addition in multiplication you can verify that
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,26:25,26:34,in multiplication you can verify that in multiplication you can verify that once we define numbers in this manner once we define numbers in this manner once we define numbers in this manner then all of pianos axioms will be then all of pianos axioms will be then all of pianos axioms will be satisfied suppose we have a one variable
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,26:34,26:48,satisfied suppose we have a one variable satisfied suppose we have a one variable predicate alpha of n suppose we want to predicate alpha of n suppose we want to predicate alpha of n suppose we want to show that alpha of n is true for every n show that alpha of n is true for every n
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,26:48,27:04,show that alpha of n is true for every n belonging to the set of natural numbers belonging to the set of natural numbers belonging to the set of natural numbers we can define t as the set of all we can define t as the set of all we can define t as the set of all natural numbers so that alpha n holds
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,27:04,27:36,then we would be done because the then we would be done because the smallest inductive set is omega and omega is the same as a set of all and omega is the same as a set of all natural numbers so once we show that t natural numbers so once we show that t
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,27:36,27:54,natural numbers so once we show that t is inductive we would be done suppose is inductive we would be done suppose is inductive we would be done suppose for example we want to show that every for example we want to show that every for example we want to show that every natural number except zero is the
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,27:54,28:15,natural number except zero is the natural number except zero is the successor of a natural number suppose this is what we want to show suppose this is what we want to show then we can define t as all those then we can define t as all those then we can define t as all those natural numbers that are either equal to
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,28:15,28:37,natural numbers that are either equal to natural numbers that are either equal to or our successors suppose this is what t is and then we suppose this is what t is and then we want to show that t is inductive so this want to show that t is inductive so this
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,28:37,28:42,want to show that t is inductive so this is the question we have is the inductive is the question we have is the inductive is the question we have is the inductive to prove that t is inductive we have to to prove that t is inductive we have to
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,28:42,28:47,to prove that t is inductive we have to show two things first of all we have to show two things first of all we have to show two things first of all we have to show that empty set belongs to t but show that empty set belongs to t but
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,28:47,28:53,show that empty set belongs to t but empty set is the same is zero and zero empty set is the same is zero and zero empty set is the same is zero and zero certainly belongs to t because t certainly belongs to t because t certainly belongs to t because t contains all those natural numbers that
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,28:53,29:03,contains all those natural numbers that contains all those natural numbers that are either zero or our successors so are either zero or our successors so are either zero or our successors so zero is explicitly included here so zero is explicitly included here so zero is explicitly included here so which is the empty set belongs to t so t
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,29:03,29:11,which is the empty set belongs to t so t which is the empty set belongs to t so t satisfies the first requirement then satisfies the first requirement then satisfies the first requirement then what is the second requirement the what is the second requirement the what is the second requirement the second requirement says that if p
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,29:11,29:21,second requirement says that if p second requirement says that if p belongs to t then p plus which is n also belongs to t then p plus which is n also belongs to t then p plus which is n also belongs to t that is also satisfied belongs to t that is also satisfied
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,29:21,29:31,belongs to t that is also satisfied therefore t is indeed inductive so t is therefore t is indeed inductive so t is therefore t is indeed inductive so t is an inductive subset of the set of an inductive subset of the set of an inductive subset of the set of natural numbers but we have just seen
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,29:31,29:39,natural numbers but we have just seen natural numbers but we have just seen that there is no inductive proper subset that there is no inductive proper subset that there is no inductive proper subset of the set of all natural numbers of the set of all natural numbers of the set of all natural numbers therefore t must indeed be the set of
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,29:39,29:45,therefore t must indeed be the set of therefore t must indeed be the set of all natural numbers so this is a all natural numbers so this is a all natural numbers so this is a property that is satisfied by the set of property that is satisfied by the set of
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,29:45,29:50,property that is satisfied by the set of natural numbers every natural number natural numbers every natural number natural numbers every natural number except zero is the successor of a except zero is the successor of a except zero is the successor of a natural number so this is how we embed
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,29:50,30:22,natural number so this is how we embed natural number so this is how we embed the set of natural numbers in set theory the set of natural numbers in set theory the set of natural numbers in set theory a relation or on a set a if if x r x for all x belonging to a relation
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,30:22,30:31,x r x for all x belonging to a relation x r x for all x belonging to a relation r this reflects you wanna set a if xr x r this reflects you wanna set a if xr x r this reflects you wanna set a if xr x is true for every x belonging to a
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,30:31,30:52,is true for every x belonging to a is true for every x belonging to a similarly we say that a relation r is similarly we say that a relation r is similarly we say that a relation r is symmetric on a if x are y implies y are
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,30:52,31:13,symmetric on a if x are y implies y are symmetric on a if x are y implies y are x for all x y belonging to and a x for all x y belonging to and a x for all x y belonging to and a relation r is transitive
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,31:13,31:33,if for all x y z belonging to a x r y if for all x y z belonging to a x r y and y are z implies x lousy when a and y are z implies x lousy when a and y are z implies x lousy when a relation satisfies all these three
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,31:33,32:16,relation satisfies all these three relation satisfies all these three properties the relation that is properties the relation that is properties the relation that is reflexive symmetric and transitive on set a is an and transitive on set a is an equivalence relation on a you you as an example consider a set of natural
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,32:16,32:25,as an example consider a set of natural as an example consider a set of natural numbers and let us say two numbers are numbers and let us say two numbers are numbers and let us say two numbers are equivalent there is two numbers are in equivalent there is two numbers are in
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,32:25,32:52,equivalent there is two numbers are in relation r x ry different only if x relation r x ry different only if x relation r x ry different only if x minus y is mode which means r minus y is mode which means r minus y is mode which means r are seven seven are and so on these
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,32:52,33:18,are seven seven are and so on these are seven seven are and so on these are all mode etc are one are all mode etc are one are all mode etc are one mode similarly r r six are mine and so on so since zero r six are mine and so on so since zero r amp are by transitivity are as
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,33:18,33:32,amp are by transitivity are as amp are by transitivity are as well we also have two are r are well we also have two are r are well we also have two are r are and so on so the equivalence classes and so on so the equivalence classes
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,33:32,33:49,and so on so the equivalence classes in this case would be in this case would be in this case would be extra this is one equivalence class extra this is one equivalence class extra this is one equivalence class etcetera from the other etcetera from the other etcetera from the other equivalence class and the third
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,33:49,34:01,equivalence class and the third equivalence class and the third equivalence class would be and equivalence class would be and equivalence class would be and so this corresponds to numbers that are so this corresponds to numbers that are so this corresponds to numbers that are multiples of these are numbers that
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,34:01,34:14,multiples of these are numbers that multiples of these are numbers that are mode and these are numbers that are mode and these are numbers that are mode and these are numbers that have two more so this relation has have two more so this relation has have two more so this relation has three equivalence classes an equivalence
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,34:14,35:13,three equivalence classes an equivalence three equivalence classes an equivalence class such that any two members of it are in such that any two members of it are in relation off to each other so the equivalence class containing x so the equivalence class containing x will be denoted thus
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,35:13,35:31,formerly this is the set of all t such formerly this is the set of all t such that x r t or t are my reflectivities that x r t or t are my reflectivities that x r t or t are my reflectivities you might as well say tr x by symmetry
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,35:31,36:00,the quotient a with respect to r is the the quotient a with respect to r is the set of all equivalence classes formerly the quotient of a with respect formerly the quotient of a with respect to r is the set of all x r such that x to r is the set of all x r such that x
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,36:00,36:31,to r is the set of all x r such that x belongs to me let us see how the theory of integers let us see how the theory of integers can be embedded set theory let us consider ordered pairs of natural let us consider ordered pairs of natural numbers if m is an ordered pair we would
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,36:31,36:40,numbers if m is an ordered pair we would numbers if m is an ordered pair we would like to associate this ordered pair to like to associate this ordered pair to like to associate this ordered pair to the integer m minus n for example two the integer m minus n for example two
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,36:40,36:51,the integer m minus n for example two three can be associated to the integer three can be associated to the integer three can be associated to the integer minus one whereas three two will be minus one whereas three two will be minus one whereas three two will be associated to the integer plus one so we
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,36:51,36:59,associated to the integer plus one so we associated to the integer plus one so we would map ordered pairs of natural would map ordered pairs of natural would map ordered pairs of natural numbers on two integers in this fashion numbers on two integers in this fashion numbers on two integers in this fashion for this purpose what we do is this we
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,36:59,37:23,for this purpose what we do is this we for this purpose what we do is this we define a relation on natural numbers this relation is on natural numbers this relation is defined in this manner we say that defined in this manner we say that defined in this manner we say that ordered pair m n and p q are in this
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,37:23,37:33,ordered pair m n and p q are in this ordered pair m n and p q are in this relation if and only if m plus q is the relation if and only if m plus q is the relation if and only if m plus q is the same as n plus p of course we would have
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,37:33,37:39,same as n plus p of course we would have same as n plus p of course we would have wanted to say that m minus n is equal to wanted to say that m minus n is equal to wanted to say that m minus n is equal to p minus q but we cant say this because
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,37:39,37:47,p minus q but we cant say this because p minus q but we cant say this because the set of natural numbers is not closed the set of natural numbers is not closed the set of natural numbers is not closed under subtraction so a minus q may not
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,37:47,37:53,under subtraction so a minus q may not under subtraction so a minus q may not be a natural number but of course from be a natural number but of course from be a natural number but of course from our aromatics we know that if a minus n our aromatics we know that if a minus n
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,37:53,37:59,our aromatics we know that if a minus n is equal to p minus q then m plus q is is equal to p minus q then m plus q is is equal to p minus q then m plus q is the same as n plus p so using additions
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,37:59,38:47,the same as n plus p so using additions the same as n plus p so using additions we are effectively saying the same thing so this relationship is an equivalence so this relationship is an equivalence relation on n cross n why would this hold why would this hold thats because m plus n is equal to n
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,38:47,39:04,thats because m plus n is equal to n thats because m plus n is equal to n plus m by commutativity of addition of plus m by commutativity of addition of plus m by commutativity of addition of natural numbers so reflectivities holes natural numbers so reflectivities holes natural numbers so reflectivities holes for symmetry we require that if the
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,39:04,39:08,for symmetry we require that if the for symmetry we require that if the relation holds between m n and p q then relation holds between m n and p q then relation holds between m n and p q then the relation should also hold between p the relation should also hold between p
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,39:08,39:16,the relation should also hold between p q and q and q and mn if the relation holds between p q mn mn if the relation holds between p q mn mn if the relation holds between p q mn and p q then we have my definition m and p q then we have my definition m
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,39:16,39:31,and p q then we have my definition m plus q is equal to n plus p which by plus q is equal to n plus p which by plus q is equal to n plus p which by commutativity of addition which implies commutativity of addition which implies commutativity of addition which implies that n plus p equal to m plus q which
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,39:31,39:40,that n plus p equal to m plus q which that n plus p equal to m plus q which would imply that p q is equivalent to mn would imply that p q is equivalent to mn would imply that p q is equivalent to mn rather commutativity of addition n plus
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,39:40,39:44,rather commutativity of addition n plus rather commutativity of addition n plus p is the same as p plus n and m plus q p is the same as p plus n and m plus q p is the same as p plus n and m plus q the same as q plus m therefore p q is
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,39:44,39:52,the same as q plus m therefore p q is the same as q plus m therefore p q is equivalent to mn that is p q is in this equivalent to mn that is p q is in this equivalent to mn that is p q is in this relation tilde under with ma therefore
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,39:52,40:07,relation tilde under with ma therefore relation tilde under with ma therefore this relationship is symmetric as well this relationship is symmetric as well this relationship is symmetric as well and then you can verify transitivity if and then you can verify transitivity if and then you can verify transitivity if mn tilde p q and p q tilde are s then
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,40:07,40:16,mn tilde p q and p q tilde are s then mn tilde p q and p q tilde are s then you can easily verify that even tilde you can easily verify that even tilde you can easily verify that even tilde powers so transitivity also holds powers so transitivity also holds
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,40:16,40:28,powers so transitivity also holds therefore this is an equivalence therefore this is an equivalence therefore this is an equivalence relation then using this equivalence relation then using this equivalence relation then using this equivalence relation we can define integers in this relation we can define integers in this relation we can define integers in this manner let us define the set of integers
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,40:28,40:41,manner let us define the set of integers manner let us define the set of integers z as the quotient of n cross n under the the quotient of n cross n under the tilde function so what exactly do we do tilde function so what exactly do we do
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,40:41,40:58,tilde function so what exactly do we do here we define in digit two as the here we define in digit two as the here we define in digit two as the equivalence class that contains two zero equivalence class that contains two zero equivalence class that contains two zero the equivalence class under tilde which
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,40:58,41:18,the equivalence class under tilde which the equivalence class under tilde which contains two zero this would of course contains two zero this would of course contains two zero this would of course contain two zero three one four two this contain two zero three one four two this contain two zero three one four two this is it and it would also contain one
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,41:18,41:32,is it and it would also contain one is it and it would also contain one minus one and zero minus two so in minus one and zero minus two so in minus one and zero minus two so in particular on the xy plane if you particular on the xy plane if you
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,41:32,41:45,particular on the xy plane if you consider the integral with grids and consider the integral with grids and consider the integral with grids and consider a line of slope one which consider a line of slope one which consider a line of slope one which passes through zero minus two all the
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,41:45,41:52,passes through zero minus two all the passes through zero minus two all the integral grid points that fall on this integral grid points that fall on this integral grid points that fall on this line will form the set so this set is line will form the set so this set is
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,41:52,42:06,line will form the set so this set is what we define as integer then what what we define as integer then what what we define as integer then what would integer minus three would be that would integer minus three would be that would integer minus three would be that would be the set of
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,42:06,42:26,all paths which are equivalent to all paths which are equivalent to under this equivalence class that would under this equivalence class that would under this equivalence class that would be all the integral grid points that be all the integral grid points that be all the integral grid points that fall on the line with slope and
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,42:26,42:51,fall on the line with slope and fall on the line with slope and passes through will define this passes through will define this passes through will define this equivalence class for example equivalence class for example equivalence class for example and so on this is what is defined as integer minus
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,42:51,43:01,this is what is defined as integer minus three so we can define integers in this three so we can define integers in this three so we can define integers in this manner as equivalence classes under this manner as equivalence classes under this manner as equivalence classes under this equivalence relation tilde and then we
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,43:01,43:14,equivalence relation tilde and then we equivalence relation tilde and then we can define the operations on integers can define the operations on integers can define the operations on integers addition and multiplication on integers addition and multiplication on integers addition and multiplication on integers appropriately so using this device
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,43:14,43:23,appropriately so using this device appropriately so using this device device what we do is to define each device what we do is to define each device what we do is to define each integer as a set and then operations integer as a set and then operations integer as a set and then operations addition and multiplication that work on
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,43:23,43:32,addition and multiplication that work on addition and multiplication that work on integers would be defined as operations integers would be defined as operations integers would be defined as operations on these special sets the if the on these special sets the if the on these special sets the if the operators that we define behave in a
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,43:32,43:39,operators that we define behave in a operators that we define behave in a manner which is exactly mimicking of the manner which is exactly mimicking of the manner which is exactly mimicking of the addition and multiplication operations addition and multiplication operations addition and multiplication operations on integers then we would be able to say
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,43:39,43:46,on integers then we would be able to say on integers then we would be able to say that we have embedded the theory of that we have embedded the theory of that we have embedded the theory of integers on n cross on in in set theory integers on n cross on in in set theory
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,43:46,43:52,integers on n cross on in in set theory so that is precisely what we will so that is precisely what we will so that is precisely what we will attempt to do the details we will work attempt to do the details we will work attempt to do the details we will work out in the next class that is it from
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,43:52,44:21,out in the next class that is it from out in the next class that is it from this lecture hope to see you in the next this lecture hope to see you in the next this lecture hope to see you in the next thank you thank you thank you music
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:09,0:39,music music you music music you welcome to the npl mooc on welcome to the npl mooc on mathematics this is the third lecture on mathematics this is the third lecture on mathematics this is the third lecture on said theory at the end of the last said theory at the end of the last
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:39,0:47,said theory at the end of the last lecture we were seeing how the theory of lecture we were seeing how the theory of lecture we were seeing how the theory of integers could be embedded in set theory integers could be embedded in set theory integers could be embedded in set theory our idea was this an ordered pair mn of
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:47,0:53,our idea was this an ordered pair mn of our idea was this an ordered pair mn of natural numbers should stand for the natural numbers should stand for the natural numbers should stand for the integer m minus n then the ordered pair integer m minus n then the ordered pair
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:53,1:03,integer m minus n then the ordered pair would stand for minus ones ordered would stand for minus ones ordered would stand for minus ones ordered by will stand for so what we do by will stand for so what we do by will stand for so what we do is this we define a relation tilde on n
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:03,1:09,is this we define a relation tilde on n is this we define a relation tilde on n cross n where n is a set of natural cross n where n is a set of natural cross n where n is a set of natural numbers the idea is that ordered pairs m
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:09,1:15,numbers the idea is that ordered pairs m numbers the idea is that ordered pairs m n and p q would be in relation to live n and p q would be in relation to live n and p q would be in relation to live with each other if a n equal to p q
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:15,1:22,with each other if a n equal to p q with each other if a n equal to p q but since natural numbers are not closed but since natural numbers are not closed but since natural numbers are not closed under subtraction we essentially capture under subtraction we essentially capture
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:22,1:33,under subtraction we essentially capture the same by using addition we write m the same by using addition we write m the same by using addition we write m plus q equals n plus p we know that this plus q equals n plus p we know that this plus q equals n plus p we know that this would be the case precisely when m minus
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:33,1:38,would be the case precisely when m minus would be the case precisely when m minus n is equal to p minus q and m plus q and n is equal to p minus q and m plus q and n is equal to p minus q and m plus q and n plus p are both welldefined natural
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:38,1:44,n plus p are both welldefined natural n plus p are both welldefined natural numbers so we achieve the same end we numbers so we achieve the same end we numbers so we achieve the same end we defined the relationship tilde in this defined the relationship tilde in this
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:44,1:51,defined the relationship tilde in this fashion for an order pairs mn and pq m n fashion for an order pairs mn and pq m n fashion for an order pairs mn and pq m n is in relation tilde with p q precisely is in relation tilde with p q precisely
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:51,1:58,is in relation tilde with p q precisely when m plus q is equal to n plus p then when m plus q is equal to n plus p then when m plus q is equal to n plus p then we can see that tilde is an equivalence we can see that tilde is an equivalence
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:58,2:10,we can see that tilde is an equivalence relation because it is reflexive relation because it is reflexive relation because it is reflexive symmetric and transitive then using this symmetric and transitive then using this symmetric and transitive then using this we can express integers in this fashion we can express integers in this fashion
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:10,2:19,we can express integers in this fashion for example the integer to which we for example the integer to which we for example the integer to which we denote two z to distinguish it from the denote two z to distinguish it from the denote two z to distinguish it from the natural number two would be the
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:19,2:34,natural number two would be the natural number two would be the equivalence class to which belongs equivalence class to which belongs equivalence class to which belongs so this equivalence class would contain so this equivalence class would contain so this equivalence class would contain etcetera all etcetera all etcetera all these points would lie on the straight
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:34,2:46,these points would lie on the straight these points would lie on the straight line with slope and passing through line with slope and passing through line with slope and passing through similarly the integer which we similarly the integer which we similarly the integer which we denote minus denote minus
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:46,2:55,denote minus to distinguish it from the natural to distinguish it from the natural to distinguish it from the natural number three would be the equivalence number three would be the equivalence number three would be the equivalence class containing the ordered pair zero class containing the ordered pair zero
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:55,3:05,class containing the ordered pair zero three all the integral points belonging three all the integral points belonging three all the integral points belonging to the straight line with slope one and to the straight line with slope one and to the straight line with slope one and passing through will also belong to
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:05,3:14,passing through will also belong to passing through will also belong to the same equivalence class so all these the same equivalence class so all these the same equivalence class so all these points are equivalent under the relation points are equivalent under the relation points are equivalent under the relation tilde so that is how we define the
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:14,3:31,tilde so that is how we define the tilde so that is how we define the integers now comes the question how do integers now comes the question how do integers now comes the question how do we define the integral operators for we define the integral operators for we define the integral operators for example addition addition of integers
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:31,3:48,which we denote plus with a subscript z which we denote plus with a subscript z to distinguish it from addition of to distinguish it from addition of to distinguish it from addition of natural numbers addition of integers is natural numbers addition of integers is natural numbers addition of integers is defined in this manner ordered pairs the
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:48,4:00,defined in this manner ordered pairs the defined in this manner ordered pairs the equivalence class containing ordered equivalence class containing ordered equivalence class containing ordered pair m and under the relation tilde this pair m and under the relation tilde this pair m and under the relation tilde this is an integer this added to the integer
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:00,4:10,is an integer this added to the integer is an integer this added to the integer which is defined by the equivalence which is defined by the equivalence which is defined by the equivalence class to which ordered pair pq belongs class to which ordered pair pq belongs class to which ordered pair pq belongs so these two are integers this is one
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:10,4:18,so these two are integers this is one so these two are integers this is one integer and this is another integer this integer and this is another integer this integer and this is another integer this integer is supposed to correspond to a integer is supposed to correspond to a
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:18,4:25,integer is supposed to correspond to a minus n and this is supposed to respond minus n and this is supposed to respond minus n and this is supposed to respond to p minus q where m n pq are all to p minus q where m n pq are all
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:25,4:41,to p minus q where m n pq are all natural numbers then their sum ought to natural numbers then their sum ought to natural numbers then their sum ought to correspond to the integer a minus n plus correspond to the integer a minus n plus correspond to the integer a minus n plus p minus q which could be written as m
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:41,4:56,p minus q which could be written as m p minus q which could be written as m plus p minus in plus cube but the equivalence class under tilde to but the equivalence class under tilde to which ordered pairs of this sort will which ordered pairs of this sort will
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:56,5:13,which ordered pairs of this sort will belong would be clearly this therefore belong would be clearly this therefore belong would be clearly this therefore this ought to be the result of the this ought to be the result of the this ought to be the result of the addition we have here that is when
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:13,5:24,addition we have here that is when addition we have here that is when integers corresponding to the integers corresponding to the integers corresponding to the equivalence classes mn under tilde and equivalence classes mn under tilde and equivalence classes mn under tilde and pq under tilde are added we should get
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:24,5:32,pq under tilde are added we should get pq under tilde are added we should get the equivalence class that corresponds the equivalence class that corresponds the equivalence class that corresponds to the ordered pair m plus p n plus q if to the ordered pair m plus p n plus q if
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:32,5:39,to the ordered pair m plus p n plus q if this is how we define addition then it this is how we define addition then it this is how we define addition then it would indeed be consistent with the would indeed be consistent with the would indeed be consistent with the notion that we have the notion that we
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:39,5:48,notion that we have the notion that we notion that we have the notion that we have is that the equivalence class have is that the equivalence class have is that the equivalence class corresponding to ordered pair m n stands corresponding to ordered pair m n stands corresponding to ordered pair m n stands for the integer m minus n that is indeed
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:48,5:55,for the integer m minus n that is indeed for the integer m minus n that is indeed the case under addition defined in this the case under addition defined in this the case under addition defined in this manner then we can see that this manner then we can see that this
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:55,6:04,manner then we can see that this addition is commutative changing the addition is commutative changing the addition is commutative changing the order of the arguments will not change order of the arguments will not change order of the arguments will not change the result we will get exactly the same
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,6:04,6:34,the result we will get exactly the same the result we will get exactly the same equivalence class it is associative this is the identity of the addition this is the identity of the addition operation we have defined remember zero operation we have defined remember zero operation we have defined remember zero z is the equivalence class to which for
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,6:34,7:03,z is the equivalence class to which for z is the equivalence class to which for example one one belongs each individual example one one belongs each individual example one one belongs each individual you can see has an additive inverse under addition which is defined in this under addition which is defined in this manner we can see that when this integer
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,7:03,7:18,manner we can see that when this integer manner we can see that when this integer is added to those integers what we get is added to those integers what we get is added to those integers what we get us which is zero therefore every integer us which is zero therefore every integer
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,7:18,7:28,us which is zero therefore every integer has an additive inverse has an additive inverse has an additive inverse in short the integers that we have in short the integers that we have in short the integers that we have defined along with the operator plus defined along with the operator plus
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,7:28,7:43,defined along with the operator plus they form an abelian group you will they form an abelian group you will they form an abelian group you will recall the definition from the module on recall the definition from the module on recall the definition from the module on algebra its clear that z plus that is
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,7:43,7:48,algebra its clear that z plus that is algebra its clear that z plus that is an abelian group the other operator that an abelian group the other operator that an abelian group the other operator that we want to define on integers is we want to define on integers is
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,7:48,8:13,we want to define on integers is multiplication let us denote multiplication by stars let us denote multiplication by stars odd multiplication would be defined in odd multiplication would be defined in odd multiplication would be defined in this manner when we multiply integer a this manner when we multiply integer a
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,8:13,8:38,this manner when we multiply integer a minus n and p minus q we would like the minus n and p minus q we would like the minus n and p minus q we would like the result to be mp plus nq minus mq minus result to be mp plus nq minus mq minus
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,8:38,8:50,result to be mp plus nq minus mq minus np so with this intuitive understanding np so with this intuitive understanding np so with this intuitive understanding we can define the result of the we can define the result of the we can define the result of the multiplication as the equivalence class
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,8:50,9:06,multiplication as the equivalence class multiplication as the equivalence class containing the ordered pair mp nq this containing the ordered pair mp nq this containing the ordered pair mp nq this addition is the addition over natural addition is the addition over natural addition is the addition over natural numbers so this is how we should define
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,9:06,9:17,numbers so this is how we should define numbers so this is how we should define multiplication of integers that multiplication of integers that multiplication of integers that correspond to equivalence classes correspond to equivalence classes correspond to equivalence classes containing ordered pair mn and ordered containing ordered pair mn and ordered

209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,13:16,13:22,m plus q is less than natural number p m plus q is less than natural number p plus n the way we have defined natural plus n the way we have defined natural plus n the way we have defined natural numbers using sets we know that natural numbers using sets we know that natural
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,13:22,13:32,numbers using sets we know that natural number belongs to natural number number belongs to natural number number belongs to natural number which belongs to natural number and so which belongs to natural number and so which belongs to natural number and so on recall that correspond to the empty
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,13:32,13:46,on recall that correspond to the empty on recall that correspond to the empty set correspond to the singleton set correspond to the singleton set correspond to the singleton containing the empty set correspond to containing the empty set correspond to containing the empty set correspond to the member set containing these
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,13:46,14:01,the member set containing these the member set containing these correspond to the three member set containing these and so on so you can containing these and so on so you can see that zero belongs to one which see that zero belongs to one which see that zero belongs to one which belongs to two which belongs to three
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,14:01,14:16,belongs to two which belongs to three belongs to two which belongs to three and so on and so on and so on so you could say n belongs to p precisely when you want to say that n precisely when you want to say that n less than people so that is what we have

209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,15:59,16:04,so a button relation r on a is a linear so a button relation r on a is a linear ordering precisely when r is transitive ordering precisely when r is transitive ordering precisely when r is transitive and satisfies dichotomy so you can see and satisfies dichotomy so you can see
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,16:04,16:14,and satisfies dichotomy so you can see that the less than relation on natural that the less than relation on natural that the less than relation on natural numbers is a trichotomy for example numbers is a trichotomy for example numbers is a trichotomy for example either x less than y or y less than x or
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,16:14,16:22,either x less than y or y less than x or either x less than y or y less than x or x is equal to y and the less than x is equal to y and the less than x is equal to y and the less than relation is transitive so using the less
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,16:22,16:31,relation is transitive so using the less relation is transitive so using the less than relation on natural numbers we have than relation on natural numbers we have than relation on natural numbers we have now defined the less than relation on now defined the less than relation on now defined the less than relation on indice so with these basic definitions
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,16:31,16:39,indice so with these basic definitions indice so with these basic definitions we see that the theory of integers that we see that the theory of integers that we see that the theory of integers that we have evolved behaves exactly we have evolved behaves exactly we have evolved behaves exactly according to our intuitive understanding
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,16:39,16:43,according to our intuitive understanding according to our intuitive understanding of integers so that is why we say that of integers so that is why we say that of integers so that is why we say that the theory of integers could be embedded the theory of integers could be embedded
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,16:43,17:37,the theory of integers could be embedded in set theory now let us see so we have now defined the set of so we have now defined the set of integers z using z let us define z prime integers z using z let us define z prime integers z using z let us define z prime as z integer then we define a new
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,17:37,17:59,as z integer then we define a new as z integer then we define a new relation which we denote like this this new relation is defined as follows this new relation is defined as follows we said that ordered pair stands in this we said that ordered pair stands in this
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,17:59,18:14,we said that ordered pair stands in this relation to c by d the ordered pair c d relation to c by d the ordered pair c d relation to c by d the ordered pair c d so mind you these are ordered pairs from that crosses at prime z prime does not
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,18:14,18:22,that crosses at prime z prime does not contain zero z therefore b and d cannot contain zero z therefore b and d cannot contain zero z therefore b and d cannot be zeros so our idea is that these be zeros so our idea is that these be zeros so our idea is that these ordered pairs should stand for a by b
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,18:22,18:28,ordered pairs should stand for a by b ordered pairs should stand for a by b and c by d respectively but since on and c by d respectively but since on and c by d respectively but since on integers the division operation is not integers the division operation is not
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,18:28,18:39,integers the division operation is not defined that is integers are not closed defined that is integers are not closed defined that is integers are not closed under the division operation so we dont under the division operation so we dont under the division operation so we dont want to mention division here but what
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,18:39,18:45,want to mention division here but what want to mention division here but what we want to say is that a by b is equal we want to say is that a by b is equal we want to say is that a by b is equal to c by d let us we want to say that
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,18:45,18:48,to c by d let us we want to say that to c by d let us we want to say that ordered pair a b and ordered pair c d ordered pair a b and ordered pair c d ordered pair a b and ordered pair c d stand in this relation precisely when
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,18:48,18:53,stand in this relation precisely when stand in this relation precisely when the fraction a by b is equal to the the fraction a by b is equal to the the fraction a by b is equal to the fraction c by d these two fractions are fraction c by d these two fractions are
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,18:53,19:03,fraction c by d these two fractions are well defined because b and d are non well defined because b and d are non well defined because b and d are non zero but this would be the case zero but this would be the case zero but this would be the case precisely when a into d equals b into c
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,19:03,19:13,precisely when a into d equals b into c precisely when a into d equals b into c so that is precisely what we are going so that is precisely what we are going so that is precisely what we are going to say we would say that ordered pair a
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,19:13,19:20,to say we would say that ordered pair a to say we would say that ordered pair a b stands in this relation to ordered b stands in this relation to ordered b stands in this relation to ordered pair c d precisely when a multiplied by pair c d precisely when a multiplied by
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,19:20,19:39,pair c d precisely when a multiplied by d we use the integer multiplication is d we use the integer multiplication is d we use the integer multiplication is the same as b multiplied by c so this is how we define the so this is how we define the relationship and then on this
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,19:39,19:59,relationship and then on this relationship and then on this relationship we consider a set of relationship we consider a set of relationship we consider a set of equivalence classes we define the set of equivalence classes we define the set of equivalence classes we define the set of rational numbers which we define as q as
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,19:59,20:30,rational numbers which we define as q as rational numbers which we define as q as the equivalence class the set of the equivalence class the set of the equivalence class the set of equivalence classes of z cross z prime what does this mean it means that the what does this mean it means that the rational number to this is of course
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,20:30,21:01,rational number to this is of course rational number to this is of course by this corresponds to the equivalence by this corresponds to the equivalence by this corresponds to the equivalence class containing the ordered pair under and under this relation this would under and under this relation this would of course contain
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,21:01,21:24,so this set is defined as the rational so this set is defined as the rational number two this set will stand for the number two this set will stand for the number two this set will stand for the rational number two so exactly as we did rational number two so exactly as we did
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,21:24,21:36,rational number two so exactly as we did before we will now equate every rational before we will now equate every rational before we will now equate every rational number to a set so in particular on the number to a set so in particular on the number to a set so in particular on the xy plane where would these points fall
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,21:36,21:53,xy plane where would these points fall xy plane where would these points fall we have two one here for two here and so we have two one here for two here and so we have two one here for two here and so on on on so this would these points would fall on
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,21:53,22:16,so this would these points would fall on so this would these points would fall on a line with slope one by two passing a line with slope one by two passing a line with slope one by two passing through the origin so we consider all integral grid points
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,22:16,22:25,so we consider all integral grid points that fall on the line with slope by that fall on the line with slope by that fall on the line with slope by and passing through the origin these and passing through the origin these and passing through the origin these points would correspond to in desire a
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,22:25,22:39,points would correspond to in desire a points would correspond to in desire a tional number all the integral points tional number all the integral points tional number all the integral points falling on this line would form the set falling on this line would form the set falling on this line would form the set which is defined as rational number
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,22:39,22:59,then let us consider minus by the then let us consider minus by the rational number minus by this would rational number minus by this would rational number minus by this would correspond to the equivalence class correspond to the equivalence class correspond to the equivalence class containing the ordered pair minus by
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,22:59,23:11,containing the ordered pair minus by containing the ordered pair minus by under this relationship if you enumerate under this relationship if you enumerate under this relationship if you enumerate some of the ordered pairs belonging to some of the ordered pairs belonging to some of the ordered pairs belonging to this we would have minus by minus
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,23:11,23:45,this we would have minus by minus this we would have minus by minus minus y minus these would correspond to the integral these would correspond to the integral points on the line passing through the points on the line passing through the points on the line passing through the origin
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,23:45,24:12,that is a few plot to consider zero zero that is a few plot to consider zero zero here we want minus by and minus here we want minus by and minus here we want minus by and minus to be on the line so it will pass to be on the line so it will pass
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,24:12,24:28,to be on the line so it will pass through these two points so this has a through these two points so this has a through these two points so this has a slope of minus and every integral grid slope of minus and every integral grid slope of minus and every integral grid point falling on this line would form
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,24:28,24:33,point falling on this line would form point falling on this line would form the set would be in the set which is the set would be in the set which is the set would be in the set which is defined as minus of by the rational defined as minus of by the rational
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,24:33,24:46,defined as minus of by the rational number minus by so in the sense we number minus by so in the sense we number minus by so in the sense we define every rational number as a set so define every rational number as a set so define every rational number as a set so under this definition every rational
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,24:46,24:52,under this definition every rational under this definition every rational number is defined as a set so this is number is defined as a set so this is number is defined as a set so this is analogues to what we did earlier we analogues to what we did earlier we
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,24:52,24:58,analogues to what we did earlier we defined every natural number as a set defined every natural number as a set defined every natural number as a set first of all then we defined every first of all then we defined every first of all then we defined every integer associate and now we define
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,24:58,25:05,integer associate and now we define integer associate and now we define every rational number as a set as well every rational number as a set as well every rational number as a set as well then how would we define addition and then how would we define addition and
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,25:05,25:21,then how would we define addition and multiplication of rational numbers first multiplication of rational numbers first multiplication of rational numbers first we want to define addition of rational we want to define addition of rational we want to define addition of rational numbers so let us consider two rational
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,25:21,25:40,numbers so let us consider two rational numbers so let us consider two rational numbers that correspond to equivalence classes that correspond to equivalence classes containing ordered pair a b and c containing ordered pair a b and c containing ordered pair a b and c respectively these intuitively respectively these intuitively
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,25:40,25:48,respectively these intuitively correspond to a by b and c by d so our correspond to a by b and c by d so our correspond to a by b and c by d so our requirement is this we want to add the requirement is this we want to add the
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,25:48,25:55,requirement is this we want to add the fractions a by b and c by d at the fractions a by b and c by d at the fractions a by b and c by d at the rational numbers a by b and c by d we rational numbers a by b and c by d we
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,25:55,26:04,rational numbers a by b and c by d we know that when we add them together we know that when we add them together we know that when we add them together we will get bd in the denominator and ad will get bd in the denominator and ad
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,26:04,26:22,will get bd in the denominator and ad plus bc in the numerator this would plus bc in the numerator this would plus bc in the numerator this would correspond to the ordered pair ad plus correspond to the ordered pair ad plus correspond to the ordered pair ad plus bc comma b d so the equivalence class
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,26:22,26:35,bc comma b d so the equivalence class bc comma b d so the equivalence class containing this ordered pair under the containing this ordered pair under the containing this ordered pair under the relationship we have defined should be relationship we have defined should be relationship we have defined should be the result of the addition so if the
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,26:35,26:45,the result of the addition so if the the result of the addition so if the addition of rational numbers is defined addition of rational numbers is defined addition of rational numbers is defined in this manner it would exactly in this manner it would exactly in this manner it would exactly correspond to the intuition we have so
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,26:45,26:50,correspond to the intuition we have so correspond to the intuition we have so that is how we will define the addition that is how we will define the addition that is how we will define the addition of natural numbers and then we can see of natural numbers and then we can see
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,26:50,27:44,of natural numbers and then we can see that according to this definition that according to this definition that according to this definition addition is commutative the equivalence class divided by a the equivalence class divided by a nonzero integer this is the identity of nonzero integer this is the identity of
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,27:44,28:00,nonzero integer this is the identity of the addition as you can readily verify the addition as you can readily verify the addition as you can readily verify and we can also see that this addition and we can also see that this addition and we can also see that this addition is invertible that is for all a
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,28:00,28:12,is invertible that is for all a is invertible that is for all a belonging to q that accessor be in q belonging to q that accessor be in q belonging to q that accessor be in q such that a and b added using this such that a and b added using this
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,28:12,28:29,such that a and b added using this addition operator will render q so addition operator will render q so addition operator will render q so every rational number has an additive every rational number has an additive every rational number has an additive inverse therefore we have that set of
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,28:29,28:44,inverse therefore we have that set of inverse therefore we have that set of rational numbers along with the addition rational numbers along with the addition rational numbers along with the addition operation is an abelian group exactly as operation is an abelian group exactly as operation is an abelian group exactly as it was in the case of integers now
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,28:44,28:57,it was in the case of integers now it was in the case of integers now coming to multiplication you can really work out how you can really work out how multiplication has to be defined we multiplication has to be defined we multiplication has to be defined we consider multiplication of rational
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,28:57,29:10,consider multiplication of rational consider multiplication of rational numbers so let us say we want to numbers so let us say we want to numbers so let us say we want to multiply the rational numbers multiply the rational numbers multiply the rational numbers corresponding to the equivalence class corresponding to the equivalence class

209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,29:34,29:45,we want to multiply from our we want to multiply from our understanding of rational numbers we understanding of rational numbers we understanding of rational numbers we know that the answer would be ac by bd know that the answer would be ac by bd know that the answer would be ac by bd so we should define the equivalence

209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,33:12,33:19,integers in particular b and d are integers in particular b and d are nonzero integers we will be able to say nonzero integers we will be able to say nonzero integers we will be able to say those precisely when ad less than bc those precisely when ad less than bc
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,33:19,33:33,those precisely when ad less than bc where this is the integer relationship where this is the integer relationship where this is the integer relationship so we will be able to say this precisely so we will be able to say this precisely so we will be able to say this precisely when ad is less than bc integer ad is
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,33:33,33:47,when ad is less than bc integer ad is when ad is less than bc integer ad is less than integer bc you can readily see less than integer bc you can readily see less than integer bc you can readily see that this relationship is a linear order satisfies dichotomy and this transitive
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,33:47,34:08,satisfies dichotomy and this transitive so we have now shown that rational so we have now shown that rational so we have now shown that rational numbers is embeddable the theory of rational numbers is the theory of rational numbers is embeddable in set theory but the way we embeddable in set theory but the way we
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,34:08,34:19,embeddable in set theory but the way we have defined the rational numbers have defined the rational numbers have defined the rational numbers integers which form a subset of rational integers which form a subset of rational integers which form a subset of rational numbers is not a subset of q that is the
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,34:19,34:29,numbers is not a subset of q that is the numbers is not a subset of q that is the way we have defined z and the way we way we have defined z and the way we way we have defined z and the way we have defined q that is not a subset of q
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,34:29,34:37,have defined q that is not a subset of q have defined q that is not a subset of q we have used different definition we have used different definition we have used different definition techniques for z and q but then is this techniques for z and q but then is this
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,34:37,34:47,techniques for z and q but then is this a contradiction a contradiction a contradiction not exactly thats because we can define not exactly thats because we can define not exactly thats because we can define a set called z q as the set of all a set called z q as the set of all
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,34:47,35:06,a set called z q as the set of all equivalence classes of the sort consider all ordered pairs n and the consider all ordered pairs n and the equivalence classes defined by them so equivalence classes defined by them so equivalence classes defined by them so the set of all these equivalence classes
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,35:06,35:14,the set of all these equivalence classes the set of all these equivalence classes will form zq so they correspond to will form zq so they correspond to will form zq so they correspond to rational numbers in which the rational numbers in which the rational numbers in which the denominators an integer is precisely a
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,35:14,35:23,denominators an integer is precisely a denominators an integer is precisely a rational number in which the denominator rational number in which the denominator rational number in which the denominator is so we define zq as this set so you is so we define zq as this set so you
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,35:23,35:29,is so we define zq as this set so you can readily see that zq is the set of can readily see that zq is the set of can readily see that zq is the set of integers they will function like integers they will function like integers they will function like integers within the set of all rational
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,35:29,35:36,integers within the set of all rational integers within the set of all rational numbers so we can see that zq and the numbers so we can see that zq and the numbers so we can see that zq and the set z that we defined earlier are set z that we defined earlier are
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,35:36,35:55,set z that we defined earlier are isomorphic they have exactly the same isomorphic they have exactly the same isomorphic they have exactly the same mathematical behavior now we have an mathematical behavior now we have an mathematical behavior now we have an interesting theorem we know that z is
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,35:55,36:24,interesting theorem we know that z is interesting theorem we know that z is countable what is a countable set we say that a what is a countable set we say that a set a is countable if there is a set a is countable if there is a set a is countable if there is a onetoone mapping
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,36:24,36:54,from a into n now how do we know that z from a into n now how do we know that z is comfortable consider the set of all is comfortable consider the set of all is comfortable consider the set of all integers so integers go on on both sides of zero
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,36:54,37:02,so integers go on on both sides of zero we have the positive side here and the we have the positive side here and the we have the positive side here and the negative side here we should devise a negative side here we should devise a negative side here we should devise a way of counting these integers so you
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,37:02,37:05,way of counting these integers so you way of counting these integers so you should be able to say that this is the should be able to say that this is the should be able to say that this is the th integer this is the first integer th integer this is the first integer
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,37:05,37:15,th integer this is the first integer the second integer and so on you count the second integer and so on you count the second integer and so on you count only using natural numbers so if you only using natural numbers so if you only using natural numbers so if you count in this manner zero followed by
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,37:15,37:26,count in this manner zero followed by count in this manner zero followed by one followed by minus then then one followed by minus then then one followed by minus then then minus then then minus if you minus then then minus if you minus then then minus if you continue in this manner then you can
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,37:26,37:33,continue in this manner then you can continue in this manner then you can readily see that we are defining a readily see that we are defining a readily see that we are defining a onetoone mapping from the set of onetoone mapping from the set of onetoone mapping from the set of integers onto the set of natural numbers
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,37:33,37:39,integers onto the set of natural numbers integers onto the set of natural numbers so we will be threading the integers in so we will be threading the integers in so we will be threading the integers in this fashion zero to one one two one this fashion zero to one one two one
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,37:39,37:49,this fashion zero to one one two one one two two two two three and one two two two two three and one two two two two three and so on so if you thread integers in this so on so if you thread integers in this so on so if you thread integers in this manner you find that every integer will
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,37:49,37:57,manner you find that every integer will manner you find that every integer will be threaded together we are giving one be threaded together we are giving one be threaded together we are giving one particular ordinal position for every particular ordinal position for every particular ordinal position for every single integer in the enumeration that
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,37:57,38:13,single integer in the enumeration that single integer in the enumeration that we make so we are enumerated the we make so we are enumerated the we make so we are enumerated the integers in this enumeration is built in the in this enumeration is built in the onetoone mapping from the set of
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,38:13,38:27,onetoone mapping from the set of onetoone mapping from the set of integers onto the natural numbers that integers onto the natural numbers that integers onto the natural numbers that we talked about therefore the set of all we talked about therefore the set of all we talked about therefore the set of all integers namely zed is countable you can
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,38:27,38:50,integers namely zed is countable you can integers namely zed is countable you can count them using natural numbers count them using natural numbers count them using natural numbers what about q first of all let us what about q first of all let us what about q first of all let us consider one quadrant that is only the
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,38:50,39:21,consider one quadrant that is only the consider one quadrant that is only the nonnegative rational numbers let us first show that the set of all let us first show that the set of all these are countable but we will start these are countable but we will start these are countable but we will start off with all ordered pairs of natural
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,39:21,40:17,off with all ordered pairs of natural off with all ordered pairs of natural numbers so order types of natural numbers would so order types of natural numbers would be amp be amp be amp and so on how would be enumerate all these ordered how would be enumerate all these ordered pairs we could thread them together in
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,40:17,40:25,pairs we could thread them together in pairs we could thread them together in this manner let us say you start from this manner let us say you start from this manner let us say you start from zero zero then we come to then zero zero then we come to then
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,40:25,40:43,zero zero then we come to then into and then here of course we would have as well here of course we would have as well so if you thread the ordered pairs in so if you thread the ordered pairs in so if you thread the ordered pairs in this manner you can see that every
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,40:43,40:51,this manner you can see that every this manner you can see that every single ordered pair would be in this single ordered pair would be in this single ordered pair would be in this list that is we are giving an ordinal list that is we are giving an ordinal
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,40:51,40:58,list that is we are giving an ordinal position for every single ordered pair position for every single ordered pair position for every single ordered pair when we enumerate them in this manner so when we enumerate them in this manner so when we enumerate them in this manner so is the first ordered pair is the
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,40:58,41:04,is the first ordered pair is the is the first ordered pair is the second and is the third is the second and is the third is the second and is the third is the fourth is v is the sixth and so fourth is v is the sixth and so
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,41:04,41:13,fourth is v is the sixth and so on so if you enumerate them in this on so if you enumerate them in this on so if you enumerate them in this manner what exactly is the technique we manner what exactly is the technique we manner what exactly is the technique we are using we are enumerated ordered
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,41:13,41:26,are using we are enumerated ordered are using we are enumerated ordered pairs in the order of the sum of the pairs in the order of the sum of the pairs in the order of the sum of the first component and the second component for example alone stands for the
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,41:26,41:37,for example alone stands for the class of ordered pairs in which the sum class of ordered pairs in which the sum class of ordered pairs in which the sum is amp correspond to the class is amp correspond to the class is amp correspond to the class of ordered pairs in which the sum is
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,41:37,41:46,of ordered pairs in which the sum is of ordered pairs in which the sum is then we have the set of ordered pairs in then we have the set of ordered pairs in then we have the set of ordered pairs in which the sum is amp all which the sum is amp all
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,41:46,41:58,which the sum is amp all have a sum of so we have sum of have a sum of so we have sum of have a sum of so we have sum of coming first sum of coming next sum of coming first sum of coming next sum of coming first sum of coming next sum of coming third and so on
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,41:58,42:05,coming third and so on coming third and so on so this is how we will enumerate the so this is how we will enumerate the so this is how we will enumerate the ordered pairs now you can figure out how ordered pairs now you can figure out how
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,42:05,42:13,ordered pairs now you can figure out how to go from an enumeration of ordered to go from an enumeration of ordered to go from an enumeration of ordered pairs of natural numbers to an pairs of natural numbers to an pairs of natural numbers to an enumeration of rational numbers so i am
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,42:13,42:17,enumeration of rational numbers so i am enumeration of rational numbers so i am leaving it to you as an exercise for now leaving it to you as an exercise for now leaving it to you as an exercise for now we will discuss it again later that is we will discuss it again later that is
209.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,42:17,42:26,we will discuss it again later that is all from this lecture today hope to see all from this lecture today hope to see all from this lecture today hope to see you in the next thank you
