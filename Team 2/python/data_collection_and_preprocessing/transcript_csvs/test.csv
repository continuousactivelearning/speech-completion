200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:42,1:16,mathematical logic today and we begin with propositional calculus propositional calculus is also called propositional calculus is also called propositional logic sentential logic zerothorder logic as opposed to zerothorder logic as opposed to firstorder logic which is a richer firstorder logic which is a richer firstorder logic which is a richer logic and we shall study later in
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:16,1:30,logic and we shall study later in logic and we shall study later in propositional calculus we deal with propositional calculus we deal with propositional calculus we deal with propositions these propositions take on propositions these propositions take on propositions these propositions take on truth values the only semantic entities
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:30,1:43,truth values the only semantic entities truth values the only semantic entities that we deal in propositional calculus that we deal in propositional calculus that we deal in propositional calculus are truth values the truth values could are truth values the truth values could are truth values the truth values could be or or true or false corresponds
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:43,2:05,be or or true or false corresponds be or or true or false corresponds to false and corresponds to there to false and corresponds to there to false and corresponds to there are only two twos are only two twos are only two twos there is no third truth value
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:05,2:21,music music propositions take on truth values as i propositions take on truth values as i propositions take on truth values as i mentioned there are what are called mentioned there are what are called mentioned there are what are called atomic propositions for these atomic atomic propositions for these atomic
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:21,2:37,atomic propositions for these atomic propositions the truth values are given that is we do not analyze these atomic that is we do not analyze these atomic propositions to find out how they became propositions to find out how they became propositions to find out how they became true or false we just know that they are
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:37,2:44,true or false we just know that they are true or false we just know that they are true or false and then we can combine true or false and then we can combine true or false and then we can combine atomic propositions to form what are atomic propositions to form what are
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:44,2:59,atomic propositions to form what are called composite propositions composite called composite propositions composite called composite propositions composite propositions are made using atomic propositions are made using atomic propositions are made using atomic propositions and these atomic propositions and these atomic propositions and these atomic propositions are combined using logical
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:59,3:18,propositions are combined using logical propositions are combined using logical connectives that is composite connectives that is composite connectives that is composite propositions are synthesized from atomic propositions are synthesized from atomic propositions are synthesized from atomic propositions using logical connectives propositions using logical connectives propositions using logical connectives we can compute the truth values of
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:18,3:34,we can compute the truth values of we can compute the truth values of composite propositions using the truth values of its using the truth values of its constituents and also the properties of constituents and also the properties of constituents and also the properties of logical connectives this essentially
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:34,3:58,logical connectives this essentially logical connectives this essentially gives us an algebra of truth values music music algebra of and this algebra is algebra of and this algebra is algebra of and this algebra is called called called boolean algebra after mathematician boolean algebra after mathematician boolean algebra after mathematician george boole so let us begin with a
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:58,4:05,george boole so let us begin with a george boole so let us begin with a study of this algebra boolean algebra study of this algebra boolean algebra study of this algebra boolean algebra which is the underlying algebra of which is the underlying algebra of which is the underlying algebra of propositional calculus so in boolean
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:05,4:23,propositional calculus so in boolean propositional calculus so in boolean algebra we have what are called boolean algebra we have what are called boolean algebra we have what are called boolean functions a boolean function has a functions a boolean function has a functions a boolean function has a signature of this form a boolean
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:23,4:34,signature of this form a boolean signature of this form a boolean function is a mapping from to truth function is a mapping from to truth function is a mapping from to truth values so a boolean function with n values so a boolean function with n values so a boolean function with n inputs an invariable boolean function
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:34,4:48,inputs an invariable boolean function inputs an invariable boolean function takes n truth values as inputs and takes n truth values as inputs and takes n truth values as inputs and produces one truth value as the output so let us consider truth values of so let us consider truth values of boolean functions for various values of
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:48,4:58,boolean functions for various values of boolean functions for various values of n when n equal to that means when n when n equal to that means when n when n equal to that means when there is no input there are two boolean there is no input there are two boolean
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:58,5:09,there is no input there are two boolean functions one is the constant boolean functions one is the constant boolean functions one is the constant boolean function true which always produces one function true which always produces one function true which always produces one and then the constant boolean function f
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:09,5:20,and then the constant boolean function f and then the constant boolean function f which always produces so these are the which always produces so these are the which always produces so these are the variable boolean functions when we variable boolean functions when we variable boolean functions when we consider one variable boolean functions
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:20,5:37,we are considering functions that take we are considering functions that take one boolean value as input and produce one boolean value as input and produce one boolean value as input and produce one boolean value as output functions of one boolean value as output functions of one boolean value as output functions of this signature
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:37,5:49,this signature this signature such a function can be specified using such a function can be specified using such a function can be specified using what is called a tooth table in a truth what is called a tooth table in a truth what is called a tooth table in a truth table we list the inputs so in this case
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:49,5:57,table we list the inputs so in this case table we list the inputs so in this case there is only one input and specify the there is only one input and specify the there is only one input and specify the possible outputs so input here could be possible outputs so input here could be
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:57,6:08,possible outputs so input here could be either or if the input is what either or if the input is what either or if the input is what would the output be if the input is would the output be if the input is would the output be if the input is what is going to be the output once you
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,6:08,6:14,what is going to be the output once you what is going to be the output once you specify these we have the two table for specify these we have the two table for specify these we have the two table for function f now how many such functions function f now how many such functions
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,6:14,6:25,function f now how many such functions could be there depending on how you could be there depending on how you could be there depending on how you choose f of and f of we will have choose f of and f of we will have choose f of and f of we will have different boolean functions which means
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,6:25,6:29,different boolean functions which means different boolean functions which means there are two choices to be made one there are two choices to be made one there are two choices to be made one choice for f of amp toys for f of choice for f of amp toys for f of
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,6:29,6:38,choice for f of amp toys for f of each choice is going to be a boolean each choice is going to be a boolean each choice is going to be a boolean value so there are going to be such value so there are going to be such value so there are going to be such possible choices so let us enumerate all
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,6:38,6:49,possible choices so let us enumerate all possible choices so let us enumerate all such boolean functions when input x is such boolean functions when input x is such boolean functions when input x is or the output could be both zeros we or the output could be both zeros we
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,6:49,6:55,or the output could be both zeros we are choosing for both f of and f of are choosing for both f of and f of are choosing for both f of and f of or we could choose for f of and or we could choose for f of and
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,6:55,7:02,or we could choose for f of and for f of or we could choose for f of for f of or we could choose for f of for f of or we could choose for f of and for f f or we could choose and for f f or we could choose
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,7:02,7:11,and for f f or we could choose for both so these are the four possible for both so these are the four possible for both so these are the four possible choices for f of and f of each choices for f of and f of each choices for f of and f of each choice will define one boolean function
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,7:11,7:27,choice will define one boolean function choice will define one boolean function so we have for one variable boolean so we have for one variable boolean so we have for one variable boolean functions functions functions music now let us name these functions in now let us name these functions in particular let us look at the first
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,7:27,7:36,particular let us look at the first particular let us look at the first column in the first column both the column in the first column both the column in the first column both the function values are therefore let me function values are therefore let me function values are therefore let me call this the zero function the function
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,7:36,7:45,call this the zero function the function call this the zero function the function which produces zero irrespective of the which produces zero irrespective of the which produces zero irrespective of the input value similarly look at the last input value similarly look at the last input value similarly look at the last column here f of is and f of is
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,7:45,7:53,column here f of is and f of is column here f of is and f of is also so this is a function which also so this is a function which also so this is a function which produces irrespective of the input produces irrespective of the input produces irrespective of the input value so let me call this function now
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,7:53,7:59,value so let me call this function now value so let me call this function now the first column these are the th and the first column these are the th and the first column these are the th and the third column respectively so let me the third column respectively so let me
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,7:59,8:08,the third column respectively so let me consider this first column now which consider this first column now which consider this first column now which corresponds to output values and so corresponds to output values and so corresponds to output values and so when you observe that these reproduce when you observe that these reproduce
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,8:08,8:20,when you observe that these reproduce the input we realize that this function the input we realize that this function the input we realize that this function is nothing but x so this is the identity is nothing but x so this is the identity is nothing but x so this is the identity function f of x equals x the first
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,8:20,8:28,function f of x equals x the first function f of x equals x the first column corresponds to the identity column corresponds to the identity column corresponds to the identity function so let me call it x it function so let me call it x it function so let me call it x it reproduces x when you look at the second
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,8:28,8:35,reproduces x when you look at the second reproduces x when you look at the second column you find that it complements x column you find that it complements x column you find that it complements x when x is it produces and when x is when x is it produces and when x is
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,8:35,8:52,when x is it produces and when x is it produces so this is the it produces so this is the it produces so this is the complement of x this we call x bar the complement of x this we call x bar the complement of x this we call x bar the negation of its negation of x
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,8:52,9:01,in words the truth value when x is two in words the truth value when x is two it produces false and when x is false it it produces false and when x is false it it produces false and when x is false it produces two negation of xs denoted
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,9:01,9:15,produces two negation of xs denoted produces two negation of xs denoted variously in these ways so we will use variously in these ways so we will use variously in these ways so we will use all these notations interchangeably so all these notations interchangeably so all these notations interchangeably so you should remember these notations
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,9:15,9:24,you should remember these notations you should remember these notations negation of x could be represented in negation of x could be represented in negation of x could be represented in any of these ways so we have now seen any of these ways so we have now seen any of these ways so we have now seen for one variable boolean functions now
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,9:24,9:39,for one variable boolean functions now for one variable boolean functions now let us go on to look at two variable let us go on to look at two variable let us go on to look at two variable boolean functions how many two variable boolean functions how many two variable
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,9:39,9:50,boolean functions how many two variable boolean functions could there be let us boolean functions could there be let us boolean functions could there be let us say x and y are the inputs to our two say x and y are the inputs to our two say x and y are the inputs to our two variable boolean functions since there
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,9:50,10:04,variable boolean functions since there variable boolean functions since there are two boolean inputs the possible are two boolean inputs the possible are two boolean inputs the possible inputs are and so these inputs are and so these inputs are and so these four are the form the set of all
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,10:04,10:15,four are the form the set of all four are the form the set of all possible inputs now what could the possible inputs now what could the possible inputs now what could the output be f of x y to specify f of x y output be f of x y to specify f of x y
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,10:15,10:21,output be f of x y to specify f of x y you have to specify a boolean value at you have to specify a boolean value at you have to specify a boolean value at each of these four positions so there each of these four positions so there
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,10:21,10:48,each of these four positions so there are positions to be filled in using are positions to be filled in using are positions to be filled in using amp so there are power which is so there are power which is possibilities let us look at all these possibilities let us look at all these
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,10:48,11:12,possibilities let us look at all these possibilities so enumerate all these possibilities so enumerate all these possibilities so enumerate all these possibilities let us consider all possibilities let us consider all possibilities let us consider all possible inputs and so possible inputs and so possible inputs and so there are vacancies to be filled f of
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,11:12,11:23,there are vacancies to be filled f of there are vacancies to be filled f of x y could be any of these so the x y could be any of these so the x y could be any of these so the first one is and the next one is
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,11:23,11:40,first one is and the next one is first one is and the next one is double third one is double double third one is double double third one is double and the fourth one is double and and the fourth one is double and and the fourth one is double and the next one is then
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,11:40,12:01,the next one is then the next one is then these form one half of the these form one half of the these form one half of the possibilities the remaining possibilities the remaining possibilities the remaining possibilities will complement these then possibilities will complement these then possibilities will complement these then we have triple then we have double
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,12:01,12:35,we have triple then we have double we have triple then we have double double double double so those are the so those are the so those are the possibilities so let me number the possibilities so let me number the possibilities so let me number the columns in this fashion starting from
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,12:35,12:48,columns in this fashion starting from columns in this fashion starting from and going up to there are sixteen and going up to there are sixteen and going up to there are sixteen such columns such columns such columns music music music now let us analyze these columns look at
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,12:48,12:53,now let us analyze these columns look at now let us analyze these columns look at the th column the th column produces a the th column the th column produces a the th column the th column produces a irrespective of the input whatever be irrespective of the input whatever be
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,12:53,13:05,irrespective of the input whatever be the values of x and y the output is the values of x and y the output is the values of x and y the output is therefore we call this the function its mirror image its mirror image this column in column the output
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,13:05,13:15,this column in column the output this column in column the output is irrespective of the input value is irrespective of the input value is irrespective of the input value therefore this function we call now therefore this function we call now therefore this function we call now consider the first column in the first
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,13:15,13:27,consider the first column in the first consider the first column in the first column the output is precisely when column the output is precisely when column the output is precisely when both the inputs are if either x is both the inputs are if either x is both the inputs are if either x is or y is then the output is the

200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,13:38,13:47,so this is called the and function which we denote in this manner the and we denote in this manner the and we denote in this manner the and function this is one way of denoting an function this is one way of denoting an function this is one way of denoting an and function its complement is column
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,13:47,13:58,and function its complement is column and function its complement is column in column the output is if either x in column the output is if either x in column the output is if either x or y is this is the negation of the or y is this is the negation of the
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,13:58,14:10,or y is this is the negation of the and function therefore we call it nand and function therefore we call it nand and function therefore we call it nand this is called the nand function column this is called the nand function column this is called the nand function column this the and function
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,14:10,14:21,this the and function this the and function now let us look at column in column now let us look at column in column now let us look at column in column the output is precisely when both the the output is precisely when both the the output is precisely when both the inputs are or in other words the
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,14:21,14:30,inputs are or in other words the inputs are or in other words the output is if either x or y is output is if either x or y is output is if either x or y is therefore this we called the or function therefore this we called the or function
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,14:30,14:41,therefore this we called the or function column is the or function the column is the or function the column is the or function the complement of column is column there complement of column is column there complement of column is column there the output is precisely when both the
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,14:41,14:53,the output is precisely when both the the output is precisely when both the inputs are this is called the nor inputs are this is called the nor inputs are this is called the nor function the negation of the or function function the negation of the or function function the negation of the or function which is denoted like this
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,14:53,15:05,now let us come to column six column six now let us come to column six column six is one if either x is or y is but is one if either x is or y is but is one if either x is or y is but not both
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,15:05,15:11,not both not both that is exactly one of x and y should be that is exactly one of x and y should be that is exactly one of x and y should be one for the output to be one this is one for the output to be one this is
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,15:11,15:27,one for the output to be one this is called the xor function denoted in this called the xor function denoted in this called the xor function denoted in this fashion the complement of that is one fashion the complement of that is one fashion the complement of that is one precisely when both the inputs are same
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,15:27,15:32,precisely when both the inputs are same precisely when both the inputs are same that is when both the inputs are the that is when both the inputs are the that is when both the inputs are the output is when both the inputs are output is when both the inputs are
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,15:32,15:41,output is when both the inputs are the output is but when one is and the output is but when one is and the output is but when one is and the other is the output is so this the other is the output is so this the other is the output is so this function is called the equivalent
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,15:41,15:56,function is called the equivalent function is called the equivalent function or the if and only function function or the if and only function function or the if and only function denoted either this way or as an denoted either this way or as an denoted either this way or as an occurrence this is the equivalent
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,15:56,16:15,occurrence this is the equivalent occurrence this is the equivalent function now consider column column function now consider column column function now consider column column is false precisely when x is true but is false precisely when x is true but is false precisely when x is true but y is false this function is called the
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,16:15,16:26,y is false this function is called the y is false this function is called the implication function we say x implies y implication function we say x implies y implication function we say x implies y music music music we will have occasion to talk more about we will have occasion to talk more about
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,16:26,16:36,we will have occasion to talk more about the implication function that is column the implication function that is column the implication function that is column the complement of column is column the complement of column is column the complement of column is column which is the negation of implication
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,16:36,16:44,which is the negation of implication which is the negation of implication which we can denote in this fashion now which we can denote in this fashion now which we can denote in this fashion now let us look at column column is let us look at column column is
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,16:44,16:57,let us look at column column is column reproduces the x column column reproduces the x column column reproduces the x column therefore this is the identity function therefore this is the identity function therefore this is the identity function in x its complement is which is in x its complement is which is
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,16:57,17:13,in x its complement is which is column this is the negation of x now column this is the negation of x now column this is the negation of x now let us look at column which is let us look at column which is let us look at column which is which reproduces input y its complement
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,17:13,17:27,which reproduces input y its complement which reproduces input y its complement is which is column and is which is column and is which is column and therefore it is the negation of y what therefore it is the negation of y what therefore it is the negation of y what remains now column column is
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,17:27,17:35,remains now column column is remains now column column is therefore this is the reverse therefore this is the reverse therefore this is the reverse implication comparing it with column implication comparing it with column implication comparing it with column you find that this is the reverse you find that this is the reverse
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,17:35,17:46,you find that this is the reverse implication if column is a forward implication if column is a forward implication if column is a forward implication x implies y then has to implication x implies y then has to implication x implies y then has to be the reverse implication and then its
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,17:46,17:57,be the reverse implication and then its be the reverse implication and then its complement is the negation of the complement is the negation of the complement is the negation of the reverse implication so now we have named reverse implication so now we have named reverse implication so now we have named all the functions so we find that
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,17:57,18:12,all the functions so we find that all the functions so we find that some of these functions are not some of these functions are not some of these functions are not dependent on both the inputs for example dependent on both the inputs for example dependent on both the inputs for example amp are one variable functions then x
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,18:12,18:20,amp are one variable functions then x amp are one variable functions then x y negation of its negation of y are one y negation of its negation of y are one y negation of its negation of y are one variable function sorry amp are variable function sorry amp are
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,18:20,18:31,variable function sorry amp are variable functions x y x negation of y variable functions x y x negation of y variable functions x y x negation of y are one variable functions the rest are are one variable functions the rest are are one variable functions the rest are two variable functions
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,18:31,18:52,two variable functions two variable functions in general when you have a function of in general when you have a function of in general when you have a function of this form to specify the function you can draw up to specify the function you can draw up what is called the truth table in the
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,18:52,18:59,what is called the truth table in the what is called the truth table in the truth table we list all the inputs to truth table we list all the inputs to truth table we list all the inputs to the function so here there are n inputs the function so here there are n inputs

200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,20:54,21:13,now consider the truth table of a now consider the truth table of a boolean function let us say its a three boolean function let us say its a three boolean function let us say its a three variable boolean function then there are variable boolean function then there are
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,21:13,21:49,variable boolean function then there are eight rows in this truth table these are the eight rows let us say the these are the eight rows let us say the function is specified in this fashion the complement of f also will specify so the complement of f also will specify so a toothed table of a boolean function is
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,21:49,22:02,a toothed table of a boolean function is a toothed table of a boolean function is specified in this fashion so this is a specified in this fashion so this is a specified in this fashion so this is a three variable boolean function three variable boolean function three variable boolean function music
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,22:02,22:29,now let us post this question kandice now let us post this question kandice three variable boolean function be three variable boolean function be three variable boolean function be synthesized using zero one two variable synthesized using zero one two variable synthesized using zero one two variable boolean functions so this is the problem
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,22:29,22:35,boolean functions so this is the problem boolean functions so this is the problem we want to address we are given the we want to address we are given the we want to address we are given the truth table of a function a boolean truth table of a function a boolean
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,22:35,22:41,truth table of a function a boolean function of boolean function can be function of boolean function can be function of boolean function can be completely specified by specifying its completely specified by specifying its completely specified by specifying its truth table because this truth table now truth table because this truth table now
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,22:41,22:49,truth table because this truth table now maps all the possible inputs to the maps all the possible inputs to the maps all the possible inputs to the corresponding outputs so the function is corresponding outputs so the function is corresponding outputs so the function is completely specified by a truth table so
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,22:49,22:53,completely specified by a truth table so completely specified by a truth table so the function is specified using a truth the function is specified using a truth the function is specified using a truth table and we want to see if the function table and we want to see if the function
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,22:53,23:05,table and we want to see if the function can be synthesized using zero one of two can be synthesized using zero one of two can be synthesized using zero one of two variable boolean functions so what will variable boolean functions so what will variable boolean functions so what will come in handy to do this are what are
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,23:05,23:40,come in handy to do this are what are come in handy to do this are what are called de morgans laws we say that even is equivalent to e to we say that even is equivalent to e to if and only if the two tables of even if and only if the two tables of even
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,23:40,23:57,if and only if the two tables of even and e are identical that is they and e are identical that is they and e are identical that is they should have exactly the same behavior in should have exactly the same behavior in should have exactly the same behavior in terms of the output that is when we say
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,23:57,24:04,terms of the output that is when we say terms of the output that is when we say that two expressions even and e are that two expressions even and e are that two expressions even and e are equivalent now de morgans laws specify equivalent now de morgans laws specify
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,24:04,24:16,equivalent now de morgans laws specify certain equivalences it says that for certain equivalences it says that for certain equivalences it says that for two boolean variables x and y x or y by two boolean variables x and y x or y by two boolean variables x and y x or y by the way or can be denoted in either of
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,24:16,24:24,the way or can be denoted in either of the way or can be denoted in either of these two ways and an can be denoted these two ways and an can be denoted these two ways and an can be denoted either as this or a concatenation either as this or a concatenation
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,24:24,24:34,either as this or a concatenation in particular when i write x y i mean x in particular when i write x y i mean x in particular when i write x y i mean x and y so de morgans law the first de and y so de morgans law the first de
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,24:34,24:45,and y so de morgans law the first de morgans law says that the complement of morgans law says that the complement of morgans law says that the complement of x or y is the and of x complement and y x or y is the and of x complement and y
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,24:45,25:00,x or y is the and of x complement and y complement the second de morgans law complement the second de morgans law complement the second de morgans law says that the complement of the and of x says that the complement of the and of x says that the complement of the and of x and y is the or of x complement and y
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,25:00,25:10,and y is the or of x complement and y and y is the or of x complement and y compliment by the way and and is also compliment by the way and and is also compliment by the way and and is also called a conjunction and an order is
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,25:10,25:31,called a conjunction and an order is called a conjunction and an order is also called a disjunction you should be also called a disjunction you should be also called a disjunction you should be familiar with these words so these are the two de morgans laws we so these are the two de morgans laws we say that these two are equivalent the
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,25:31,25:45,say that these two are equivalent the say that these two are equivalent the lefthand side is equivalent to the lefthand side is equivalent to the lefthand side is equivalent to the righthand side but how do we show this righthand side but how do we show this righthand side but how do we show this we can show this using two tables so the
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,25:45,25:50,we can show this using two tables so the we can show this using two tables so the two variable versions of de morgans two variable versions of de morgans two variable versions of de morgans laws can be shown like this take the two laws can be shown like this take the two
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,25:50,26:11,laws can be shown like this take the two inputs x and y and consider all possible inputs x and y and consider all possible inputs x and y and consider all possible inputs and then the inputs and then the inputs and then the complements of x and y would be these
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,26:11,26:22,complements of x and y would be these complements of x and y would be these now let us consider x or y x or y would now let us consider x or y x or y would now let us consider x or y x or y would be these what then would be the
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,26:22,26:33,be these what then would be the be these what then would be the complement of x or y that would be complement of x or y that would be complement of x or y that would be put now de morgans law says that this put now de morgans law says that this
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,26:33,26:46,put now de morgans law says that this is the same as the end of x bar and y is the same as the end of x bar and y is the same as the end of x bar and y bar and is and is and is bar and is and is and is
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,26:46,26:57,bar and is and is and is and and is so you find that and and is so you find that and and is so you find that these two columns correspond exactly to these two columns correspond exactly to these two columns correspond exactly to each other therefore we have x or y the
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,26:57,27:18,each other therefore we have x or y the each other therefore we have x or y the whole bar is equivalent to x bar y bar similarly let us consider x y x y is similarly let us consider x y x y is here amp amp is amp is amp amp
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,27:18,27:31,here amp amp is amp is amp amp here amp amp is amp is amp amp is is is so x y is then what would be x y so x y is then what would be x y so x y is then what would be x y complement that would be amp and
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,27:31,27:39,complement that would be amp and complement that would be amp and what would be x bar or y bar we have x what would be x bar or y bar we have x what would be x bar or y bar we have x bar here and y bar here if you take the
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,27:39,27:45,bar here and y bar here if you take the bar here and y bar here if you take the or of them you get here here here or of them you get here here here or of them you get here here here and here so you find that they again
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,27:45,27:58,and here so you find that they again and here so you find that they again correspond these two columns correspond correspond these two columns correspond correspond these two columns correspond so the complement of x and y is so the complement of x and y is so the complement of x and y is equivalent to the r of x bar and y so
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,27:58,28:07,equivalent to the r of x bar and y so equivalent to the r of x bar and y so this truth table establishes the two de this truth table establishes the two de this truth table establishes the two de morgans laws for two variables in fact morgans laws for two variables in fact
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,28:07,28:17,morgans laws for two variables in fact you can extend this to any number of you can extend this to any number of you can extend this to any number of variables for example if you have variables for example if you have variables for example if you have variables let us say we want to compute
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,28:17,28:24,variables let us say we want to compute variables let us say we want to compute the complement of x or y or z but since the complement of x or y or z but since the complement of x or y or z but since or as an associative operator you can
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,28:24,28:41,or as an associative operator you can or as an associative operator you can write this in this manner then using write this in this manner then using write this in this manner then using demorgans law we can write this as the demorgans law we can write this as the
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,28:41,28:46,demorgans law we can write this as the conjunction of x bar and y plus the conjunction of x bar and y plus the conjunction of x bar and y plus the whole bar but then we know that y plus whole bar but then we know that y plus
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,28:46,28:53,whole bar but then we know that y plus at the whole bar is why was it bound by at the whole bar is why was it bound by at the whole bar is why was it bound by applying de morgans law for two applying de morgans law for two
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,28:53,29:06,applying de morgans law for two variables but since conjunction is variables but since conjunction is variables but since conjunction is associative associative associative we can write this as x bar y bar z bar we can write this as x bar y bar z bar we can write this as x bar y bar z bar in other words the complement of x or y
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,29:06,29:15,in other words the complement of x or y in other words the complement of x or y or z is the conjunction of x bar y bar or z is the conjunction of x bar y bar or z is the conjunction of x bar y bar and z bar similarly
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,29:15,29:36,as a duel we can also find that the as a duel we can also find that the complement of x and y and z is this by complement of x and y and z is this by complement of x and y and z is this by associativity of conjunction but that is
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,29:36,29:54,x bar or y z bar but y zed bar is y bar x bar or y z bar but y zed bar is y bar or z bar which by associativity can be or z bar which by associativity can be or z bar which by associativity can be written in this fashion
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,29:54,30:04,therefore de morgans laws can be therefore de morgans laws can be extended from two variables to three extended from two variables to three extended from two variables to three variables and thus it can also be variables and thus it can also be variables and thus it can also be extended to four variables and so on now
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,30:04,30:30,extended to four variables and so on now extended to four variables and so on now let us go back to our boolean function f and let us say we want to express f in and let us say we want to express f in terms of the inputs x and y
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,30:30,30:51,terms of the inputs x and y terms of the inputs x and y variable logical connectives logical connectives are the same thing logical connectives are the same thing as boolean functions so let us see how f as boolean functions so let us see how f as boolean functions so let us see how f can be expressed in this form for that
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,30:51,30:57,can be expressed in this form for that can be expressed in this form for that let us take another look at the boolean let us take another look at the boolean let us take another look at the boolean the tooth table corresponding to f so the tooth table corresponding to f so
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,30:57,31:17,the tooth table corresponding to f so here here we find that f is precisely here here we find that f is precisely here here we find that f is precisely when xyz are or or when xyz are or or when xyz are or or that is amp which means f is
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,31:17,31:34,that is amp which means f is that is amp which means f is logically equivalent to x bar y z bar logically equivalent to x bar y z bar logically equivalent to x bar y z bar which corresponds to or x y bar which corresponds to or x y bar
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,31:34,31:49,which corresponds to or x y bar z which corresponds to or x y z z which corresponds to or x y z z which corresponds to or x y z which corresponds to when one of which corresponds to when one of which corresponds to when one of these combinations happen then f becomes
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,31:49,31:59,these combinations happen then f becomes these combinations happen then f becomes that is what the truth table tells us that is what the truth table tells us that is what the truth table tells us so f can be expressed as a composite so f can be expressed as a composite
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,31:59,32:13,so f can be expressed as a composite expression of this form this uses the expression of this form this uses the expression of this form this uses the input variables xy and z and logical input variables xy and z and logical input variables xy and z and logical connectives and or and not and this form
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,32:13,32:37,connectives and or and not and this form connectives and or and not and this form is called the sum of products form music music that is because it is expressed as an that is because it is expressed as an that is because it is expressed as an order of several terms or corresponds to
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,32:37,32:51,the addition symbol that is why we call the addition symbol that is why we call it a sum and then each of the terms here it a sum and then each of the terms here it a sum and then each of the terms here is a conjunction for example x bar by z
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,32:51,32:58,is a conjunction for example x bar by z is a conjunction for example x bar by z bar is a conjunction its an end of bar is a conjunction its an end of bar is a conjunction its an end of three literals a literal is either three literals a literal is either
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,32:58,33:07,three literals a literal is either available or its complement so this is a available or its complement so this is a available or its complement so this is a conjunction of several literals conjunction of several literals conjunction of several literals therefore this is called the product therefore this is called the product
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,33:07,33:18,therefore this is called the product form because in arithmetic expressions form because in arithmetic expressions form because in arithmetic expressions juxtaposition corresponds to juxtaposition corresponds to juxtaposition corresponds to multiplication when several entities are multiplication when several entities are multiplication when several entities are juxtaposed we call it a product
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,33:18,33:25,juxtaposed we call it a product juxtaposed we call it a product similarly here also we call this a similarly here also we call this a similarly here also we call this a product so therefore this is a sum of product so therefore this is a sum of product so therefore this is a sum of products form so looking at the truth
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,33:25,33:29,products form so looking at the truth products form so looking at the truth table we can write the sum of products table we can write the sum of products table we can write the sum of products form of the boolean function in this form of the boolean function in this
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,33:29,33:38,form of the boolean function in this manner so this we can extend to any manner so this we can extend to any manner so this we can extend to any truth table given an invariable boolean truth table given an invariable boolean truth table given an invariable boolean functions truth table we can identify
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,33:38,33:46,functions truth table we can identify functions truth table we can identify the rows in which the boolean function the rows in which the boolean function the rows in which the boolean function becomes one then corresponding to these becomes one then corresponding to these becomes one then corresponding to these rows we can form conjunctions like this
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,33:46,33:54,rows we can form conjunctions like this rows we can form conjunctions like this so in this case there are three rows so in this case there are three rows so in this case there are three rows corresponding to and corresponding to and corresponding to and so they can be translated into product
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,33:54,33:59,so they can be translated into product so they can be translated into product forms like this x bar y z bar x y bar z forms like this x bar y z bar x y bar z forms like this x bar y z bar x y bar z x y is it
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,33:59,34:08,x y is it x y is it if either if any one of them is true if either if any one of them is true if either if any one of them is true then the function evaluates to true so then the function evaluates to true so then the function evaluates to true so what we want to say is that the function
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,34:08,34:15,what we want to say is that the function what we want to say is that the function is true if and only if at least one of is true if and only if at least one of is true if and only if at least one of these three terms is true so for any
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,34:15,34:20,these three terms is true so for any these three terms is true so for any boolean assignment at most one of them boolean assignment at most one of them boolean assignment at most one of them will be true so we want to say that f is will be true so we want to say that f is
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,34:20,34:25,will be true so we want to say that f is true if and only if exactly one of them true if and only if exactly one of them true if and only if exactly one of them is true that can be expressed using and is true that can be expressed using and
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,34:25,34:33,is true that can be expressed using and or of all these terms that is why we or of all these terms that is why we or of all these terms that is why we call this a sum of products form call this a sum of products form call this a sum of products form therefore given the truth table of a
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,34:33,34:40,therefore given the truth table of a therefore given the truth table of a boolean function we can write the sum of boolean function we can write the sum of boolean function we can write the sum of products form of the function now let us products form of the function now let us
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,34:40,34:52,products form of the function now let us consider the complement of this function consider the complement of this function consider the complement of this function this complement of the function is in this complement of the function is in this complement of the function is in rows which are not or which means
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,34:52,35:13,rows which are not or which means rows which are not or which means these rows will make the these rows will make the these rows will make the complement of f therefore i can write complement of f therefore i can write complement of f therefore i can write f bar as x bar y bar z bar which
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,35:13,35:26,f bar as x bar y bar z bar which f bar as x bar y bar z bar which corresponds to or x bar y bar z which corresponds to or x bar y bar z which corresponds to or x bar y bar z which corresponds to or x bar y z which
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,35:26,35:38,corresponds to or x bar y z which corresponds to or x bar y z which corresponds to or x y bar z which corresponds to or x y bar z which corresponds to or x y bar z which corresponds to or x y z bar which corresponds to or x y z bar which
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,35:38,35:50,corresponds to or x y z bar which corresponds to so this is the sum of corresponds to so this is the sum of corresponds to so this is the sum of products form for f bar so once you have products form for f bar so once you have
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,35:50,35:59,products form for f bar so once you have the sum of products form for f bar we the sum of products form for f bar we the sum of products form for f bar we can construct an expression for f so an can construct an expression for f so an
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,35:59,36:07,can construct an expression for f so an expression for f can be obtained using expression for f can be obtained using expression for f can be obtained using de morgans law from this sum of de morgans law from this sum of de morgans law from this sum of products form now we want an expression
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,36:07,36:12,products form now we want an expression products form now we want an expression for f which is the complement of f bar f for f which is the complement of f bar f for f which is the complement of f bar f bar is the complement of f and the
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,36:12,36:17,bar is the complement of f and the bar is the complement of f and the complement of that is f so we want to complement of that is f so we want to complement of that is f so we want to compliment the left hand side so we
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,36:17,36:21,compliment the left hand side so we compliment the left hand side so we should compliment the right hand side should compliment the right hand side should compliment the right hand side also so on the right hand side we have a also so on the right hand side we have a
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,36:21,36:30,also so on the right hand side we have a disjunction so when you compliment a disjunction so when you compliment a disjunction so when you compliment a disjunction what you need to do is to disjunction what you need to do is to disjunction what you need to do is to complement each of its terms and then
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,36:30,36:38,complement each of its terms and then complement each of its terms and then take the consumption of these take the consumption of these take the consumption of these complements so we should take the complements so we should take the complements so we should take the compliment of x bar y bar z which is by
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,36:38,36:47,compliment of x bar y bar z which is by compliment of x bar y bar z which is by de morgans law x plus y plus z de morgans law x plus y plus z de morgans law x plus y plus z plus it stands for our that has to be

200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,43:21,43:29,negation of an and of a and b and then negation of an and of a and b and then negate it what we get is the and of a nd negate it what we get is the and of a nd negate it what we get is the and of a nd how do we get this negation this
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,43:29,43:46,how do we get this negation this how do we get this negation this negation also can be synthesized using negation also can be synthesized using negation also can be synthesized using nand so if you take the nand of fer a and in so if you take the nand of fer a and in and b with its itself what we get is a
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,43:46,43:57,and b with its itself what we get is a and b with its itself what we get is a and b so we find that both and and not and b so we find that both and and not and b so we find that both and and not can be synthesized using nand

200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,48:55,49:06,produce a at the output of this but produce a at the output of this but every boolean function is not of this every boolean function is not of this every boolean function is not of this form in particular the nand function form in particular the nand function form in particular the nand function music

200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,49:31,49:38,so how would you synthesize nand using h gates alone h gates alone h gates alone that is not possible because if both the that is not possible because if both the that is not possible because if both the inputs are h gates will keep producing inputs are h gates will keep producing
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,49:38,49:48,inputs are h gates will keep producing only zeros it will never produce a so only zeros it will never produce a so only zeros it will never produce a so in and cannot be synthesized using the h in and cannot be synthesized using the h in and cannot be synthesized using the h case therefore we know that h of has
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,49:48,49:55,case therefore we know that h of has case therefore we know that h of has to be similarly we can also argue that to be similarly we can also argue that to be similarly we can also argue that h of has to be that is when both h of has to be that is when both
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,49:55,50:04,h of has to be that is when both the inputs are the output has to be the inputs are the output has to be the inputs are the output has to be otherwise we will not be able to produce otherwise we will not be able to produce otherwise we will not be able to produce for example the or function which
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,50:04,50:16,for example the or function which for example the or function which produces a when both the inputs are produces a when both the inputs are produces a when both the inputs are therefore if you visualize the truth therefore if you visualize the truth therefore if you visualize the truth table of h you find that it should be of
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,50:16,50:25,table of h you find that it should be of table of h you find that it should be of this form the first entry is and the this form the first entry is and the this form the first entry is and the last entry is now there are two
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,50:25,50:35,last entry is now there are two last entry is now there are two possibilities the two vacancies these possibilities the two vacancies these possibilities the two vacancies these vacancies can be filled in different vacancies can be filled in different vacancies can be filled in different ways so let us consider all those
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,50:35,50:53,ways so let us consider all those ways so let us consider all those possibilities so here we have one and here we have so here we have one and here we have zero then let us fill these vacancies zero then let us fill these vacancies zero then let us fill these vacancies using zero the other alternative
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,50:53,51:18,using zero the other alternative using zero the other alternative sob here or here or here so sob here or here or here so sob here or here or here so these are the possible functions that these are the possible functions that these are the possible functions that could be universal logic gates now what
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,51:18,51:30,could be universal logic gates now what could be universal logic gates now what is is the complement of is is the complement of is is the complement of y and what is it is a complement y and what is it is a complement y and what is it is a complement of x these two cannot be universal
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,51:30,51:36,of x these two cannot be universal of x these two cannot be universal because they depend only on one variable because they depend only on one variable because they depend only on one variable so using these two gates that is the so using these two gates that is the
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,51:36,51:42,so using these two gates that is the negation of y and the negation of x we negation of y and the negation of x we negation of y and the negation of x we will not be able to synthesize any will not be able to synthesize any will not be able to synthesize any boolean function which depends on both
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,51:42,51:53,boolean function which depends on both boolean function which depends on both the inputs so these two are anywhere the inputs so these two are anywhere the inputs so these two are anywhere rolled out what are the remaining this rolled out what are the remaining this rolled out what are the remaining this is nothing but the nor function and this
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,51:53,52:04,is nothing but the nor function and this is nothing but the nor function and this is nothing but the function so we find is nothing but the function so we find is nothing but the function so we find that nor and nand or the only universal that nor and nand or the only universal
200.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,52:04,52:19,that nor and nand or the only universal logic gates that is it from this lecture hope to see that is it from this lecture hope to see you in the next thank you
