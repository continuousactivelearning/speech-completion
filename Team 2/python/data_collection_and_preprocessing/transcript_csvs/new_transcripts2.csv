210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,0:38,0:45,various kind of graphs you can think of functions and their graphs but these functions and their graphs but these functions and their graphs but these graphs are very different graphs the graphs are very different graphs the graphs are very different graphs the only commonality between the two of them
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,0:45,0:54,only commonality between the two of them only commonality between the two of them is that both are pictorial is that both are pictorial is that both are pictorial representations of you can think of them representations of you can think of them representations of you can think of them as pictorial representations of certain
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,0:54,1:05,as pictorial representations of certain as pictorial representations of certain mathematical objects our graphical mathematical objects our graphical mathematical objects our graphical representations of certain mathematical representations of certain mathematical representations of certain mathematical objects so lets formally define what is objects so lets formally define what is objects so lets formally define what is our graph so its usually denoted by the
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,1:05,1:12,our graph so its usually denoted by the our graph so its usually denoted by the letter g and the graph will have two letter g and the graph will have two letter g and the graph will have two components the first is going to be components the first is going to be
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,1:12,1:21,components the first is going to be called as a vertex set which we will called as a vertex set which we will called as a vertex set which we will denote by the letter v okay so this is a denote by the letter v okay so this is a
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,1:21,1:36,denote by the letter v okay so this is a finite set and this finite set we will finite set and this finite set we will finite set and this finite set we will regard it as the vertex set the regard it as the vertex set the regard it as the vertex set the finiteness assumption is not sacrosanct
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,1:36,1:41,finiteness assumption is not sacrosanct finiteness assumption is not sacrosanct we can have graphs where the vertex set we can have graphs where the vertex set we can have graphs where the vertex set is infinite but for the time being we is infinite but for the time being we
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,1:41,1:51,is infinite but for the time being we will restrict ourselves to finite sets will restrict ourselves to finite sets will restrict ourselves to finite sets and then the second component of graphs and then the second component of graphs and then the second component of graphs is the edge set which we will denote by
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,1:51,2:05,is the edge set which we will denote by is the edge set which we will denote by e so this is again a set so we will e so this is again a set so we will e so this is again a set so we will think of them as two subsets of v in
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,2:05,2:16,think of them as two subsets of v in think of them as two subsets of v in other words look at the power set to other words look at the power set to other words look at the power set to power v from this consider all the power v from this consider all the
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,2:16,2:29,power v from this consider all the subsets of size to any subset of that subsets of size to any subset of that subsets of size to any subset of that will essentially be the edge set well will essentially be the edge set well will essentially be the edge set well see an example suppose our vertex set
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,2:29,2:47,see an example suppose our vertex set see an example suppose our vertex set suppose our vertex set is lets say suppose our vertex set is lets say suppose our vertex set is lets say amp our head set is going to be our head set is going to be two element subsets but its set is
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,2:47,3:06,two element subsets but its set is two element subsets but its set is going to be a subset consisting of two going to be a subset consisting of two going to be a subset consisting of two element subsets so if you think of this particular graph so if you think of this particular graph it has two components the first being
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,3:06,3:14,it has two components the first being it has two components the first being the vertex and the second part being the the vertex and the second part being the the vertex and the second part being the edges so here the edge set consists of edges so here the edge set consists of
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,3:14,3:30,edges so here the edge set consists of six elements so we can say that this is six elements so we can say that this is six elements so we can say that this is a graph on five vertices and six edges a graph on five vertices and six edges
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,3:30,3:42,a graph on five vertices and six edges the usual diagrammatic representation of the usual diagrammatic representation of the usual diagrammatic representation of this graph is as follows we will have this graph is as follows we will have this graph is as follows we will have one dot or one point for each vertex so
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,3:42,3:49,one dot or one point for each vertex so one dot or one point for each vertex so one two three four and five where the one two three four and five where the one two three four and five where the vertices and for each pair of edge we
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,3:49,3:57,vertices and for each pair of edge we vertices and for each pair of edge we just connect those corresponding dots so just connect those corresponding dots so just connect those corresponding dots so one two is an edge and one four is an one two is an edge and one four is an
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,3:57,4:15,one two is an edge and one four is an edge five three is an edge is an edge five three is an edge is an edge five three is an edge is an edge is another edge and is an edge is another edge and is an edge is another edge and is an edge so this is the graph that we have
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,4:15,4:20,edge so this is the graph that we have edge so this is the graph that we have in mind so this is so what we have drawn in mind so this is so what we have drawn in mind so this is so what we have drawn here is the diagrammatic representation
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,4:20,4:28,here is the diagrammatic representation here is the diagrammatic representation of this particular graph so graph you of this particular graph so graph you of this particular graph so graph you can think of as a network of nodes which can think of as a network of nodes which can think of as a network of nodes which are connected to each other and which
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,4:28,4:37,are connected to each other and which are connected to each other and which node is connected to which node is node is connected to which node is node is connected to which node is captured by the edge set so where do we captured by the edge set so where do we
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,4:37,4:46,captured by the edge set so where do we look at these things lets first see a look at these things lets first see a look at these things lets first see a problem so many different problems in problem so many different problems in problem so many different problems in mathematics can be modeled as graph
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,4:46,5:00,mathematics can be modeled as graph mathematics can be modeled as graph theoretic questions and can be solved theoretic questions and can be solved theoretic questions and can be solved lets see one problem this is known as lets see one problem this is known as lets see one problem this is known as the party problem so this is the
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,5:00,5:26,the party problem so this is the the party problem so this is the description of the problem so that lets description of the problem so that lets description of the problem so that lets say five couples okay so lets call each couple s m w okay so lets call each couple s m w m w and so on so m w
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,5:26,5:37,are there couples and one of these are there couples and one of these couples let us say m w they decide couples let us say m w they decide couples let us say m w they decide to host a party so this is a party which to host a party so this is a party which
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,5:37,5:46,to host a party so this is a party which will consist of people and these will consist of people and these will consist of people and these people when they meet some of them know people when they meet some of them know people when they meet some of them know each other before and some of them dont
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,5:46,5:55,each other before and some of them dont each other before and some of them dont know and people shake their hands so know and people shake their hands so know and people shake their hands so each person may or may not shake hands each person may or may not shake hands
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,5:55,6:11,each person may or may not shake hands with another person but the rules of with another person but the rules of with another person but the rules of this problem is that spouses dont shake this problem is that spouses dont shake this problem is that spouses dont shake each others hands so so if a is married
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,6:11,6:28,each others hands so so if a is married each others hands so so if a is married to b or if they are partners then they to b or if they are partners then they to b or if they are partners then they do not shake hands so this is the
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,6:28,6:36,do not shake hands so this is the do not shake hands so this is the setting and what is what happens is setting and what is what happens is setting and what is what happens is after the party is over m asks after the party is over m asks
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,6:36,6:45,after the party is over m asks everybody else okay so everyone asks all everybody else okay so everyone asks all everybody else okay so everyone asks all the other nine people as to how many the other nine people as to how many the other nine people as to how many hands did they shake with how many
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,6:45,6:56,hands did they shake with how many hands did they shake with how many peoples with how many people they each peoples with how many people they each peoples with how many people they each of them exchanged a handshake and they of them exchanged a handshake and they of them exchanged a handshake and they give their answers and what turns out is
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,6:56,7:05,give their answers and what turns out is give their answers and what turns out is that each one of these people had a that each one of these people had a that each one of these people had a distinct number of handshake so we will distinct number of handshake so we will
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,7:05,7:49,distinct number of handshake so we will write that as the outcome then asked write that as the outcome then asked write that as the outcome then asked about the number of handshakes each person gave a distinct number as each person gave a distinct number as reply now the party problem is the following
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,7:49,8:12,now the party problem is the following with this information can we determine with this information can we determine with this information can we determine how many people shook hands with w so how many people shook hands with w so how many people shook hands with w so determine the number of handshakes
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,8:12,8:26,involving w okay so it looks surprising involving w okay so it looks surprising because there is hardly any information because there is hardly any information because there is hardly any information but we will see that the amount of but we will see that the amount of but we will see that the amount of information that is already present is
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,8:26,8:35,information that is already present is information that is already present is enough to determine this number so m enough to determine this number so m enough to determine this number so m was a person who had asked people about was a person who had asked people about was a person who had asked people about the number of handshakes and then i and
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,8:35,8:43,the number of handshakes and then i and the number of handshakes and then i and other people they all gave answers and other people they all gave answers and other people they all gave answers and all their answers were different from all their answers were different from all their answers were different from this information we can figure out the
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,8:43,8:51,this information we can figure out the this information we can figure out the exact number of handshakes involving w exact number of handshakes involving w exact number of handshakes involving w okay so how do we solve this i mean how okay so how do we solve this i mean how
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,8:51,9:01,okay so how do we solve this i mean how do we determine this so when we know do we determine this so when we know do we determine this so when we know that the number of handshakes were that the number of handshakes were that the number of handshakes were different for each person
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,9:01,9:36,different for each person different for each person and each person can shake at most eight and each person can shake at most eight and each person can shake at most eight hands so thats a fact and the least number of handshakes is and the least number of handshakes is zero mean number of handshakes is equal
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,9:36,9:45,zero mean number of handshakes is equal zero mean number of handshakes is equal to zero so since each of the nine people to zero so since each of the nine people to zero so since each of the nine people gave distinct answers their answers has gave distinct answers their answers has
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,9:45,9:54,gave distinct answers their answers has to be one two three up to eight so each to be one two three up to eight so each to be one two three up to eight so each person they are the number of handshakes person they are the number of handshakes
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,9:54,10:04,person they are the number of handshakes is some number distinct number between is some number distinct number between is some number distinct number between to so that is all it we know lets to so that is all it we know lets to so that is all it we know lets draw this diagram at eclis we will think
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,10:04,10:18,draw this diagram at eclis we will think draw this diagram at eclis we will think of a graph so each person is a vertex in of a graph so each person is a vertex in of a graph so each person is a vertex in this graph these are
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,10:18,10:31,this graph these are this graph these are the people now m we will write it the people now m we will write it the people now m we will write it as the s this particular vertex and all as the s this particular vertex and all as the s this particular vertex and all the other vertices we will just number
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,10:31,10:36,the other vertices we will just number the other vertices we will just number them by the number of handshakes so them by the number of handshakes so them by the number of handshakes so surely there is one person who has shook surely there is one person who has shook
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,10:36,10:48,surely there is one person who has shook hands theres another person who has hands theres another person who has hands theres another person who has shook one hand another person to another shook one hand another person to another shook one hand another person to another and so on it now we could think of a
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,10:48,10:54,and so on it now we could think of a and so on it now we could think of a graph in which these are our vertices graph in which these are our vertices graph in which these are our vertices and there is an edge between two and there is an edge between two
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,10:54,11:06,and there is an edge between two vertices if there is a handshake vertices if there is a handshake vertices if there is a handshake involving the two of them okay so if we involving the two of them okay so if we involving the two of them okay so if we knew this graph then of course we can
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,11:06,11:14,knew this graph then of course we can knew this graph then of course we can determine i mean if we had this complete determine i mean if we had this complete determine i mean if we had this complete graph then from that we hope to mean we graph then from that we hope to mean we
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,11:14,11:27,graph then from that we hope to mean we know who is a spouse i mean how many know who is a spouse i mean how many know who is a spouse i mean how many handshakes are there involving the handshakes are there involving the handshakes are there involving the person whos a spouse of m but we
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,11:27,11:32,person whos a spouse of m but we person whos a spouse of m but we dont really know much about this graph dont really know much about this graph dont really know much about this graph other than the fact that if you look at other than the fact that if you look at
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,11:32,11:42,other than the fact that if you look at the number of edges the number of edges the number of edges connecting zero that is there are there connecting zero that is there are there connecting zero that is there are there are no handshakes involved in zero so are no handshakes involved in zero so
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,11:42,11:46,are no handshakes involved in zero so zero is not going to be linked to any zero is not going to be linked to any zero is not going to be linked to any other vertex one is going to be linked other vertex one is going to be linked
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,11:46,11:55,other vertex one is going to be linked to some particular thing we dont know to some particular thing we dont know to some particular thing we dont know which amongst this is connected to one which amongst this is connected to one which amongst this is connected to one from two there are two such things where
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,11:55,11:59,from two there are two such things where from two there are two such things where exactly it lands up wed have no clue exactly it lands up wed have no clue exactly it lands up wed have no clue similarly for three and similarly for similarly for three and similarly for
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,11:59,12:13,similarly for three and similarly for eight okay so there are eight edges out eight okay so there are eight edges out eight okay so there are eight edges out of eight seven edges out of seven and so of eight seven edges out of seven and so of eight seven edges out of seven and so on and for m one we dont know how many
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,12:13,12:18,on and for m one we dont know how many on and for m one we dont know how many edges are there from m one how many edges are there from m one how many edges are there from m one how many people shook hands them and we have no
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,12:18,12:28,people shook hands them and we have no people shook hands them and we have no idea but from this diagram itself we can idea but from this diagram itself we can idea but from this diagram itself we can infer some certain things eight and zero infer some certain things eight and zero
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,12:28,12:40,infer some certain things eight and zero must be married to each other the reason must be married to each other the reason must be married to each other the reason is as follows any person can shake at is as follows any person can shake at is as follows any person can shake at most eight hands he doesnt shake hands
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,12:40,12:48,most eight hands he doesnt shake hands most eight hands he doesnt shake hands with himself he doesnt shake hands with with himself he doesnt shake hands with with himself he doesnt shake hands with her spouse there are people to take her spouse there are people to take her spouse there are people to take these two out there are eight people so
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,12:48,12:55,these two out there are eight people so these two out there are eight people so eight if somebody has shook eight hands eight if somebody has shook eight hands eight if somebody has shook eight hands his spouse theres a person who has his spouse theres a person who has
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,12:55,13:07,his spouse theres a person who has shook no hands okay because the only shook no hands okay because the only shook no hands okay because the only other person with whom we didnt shake other person with whom we didnt shake other person with whom we didnt shake hands is himself so and they are a
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,13:07,13:24,hands is himself so and they are a hands is himself so and they are a couple now if you look at the person who couple now if you look at the person who couple now if you look at the person who has shook seven hands and if you look at the person who has
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,13:24,13:36,and if you look at the person who has shook one hand this one handshake person shook one hand this one handshake person shook one hand this one handshake person is has certainly shook hands with the is has certainly shook hands with the is has certainly shook hands with the eighth numbered person and he or she has
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,13:36,13:45,eighth numbered person and he or she has eighth numbered person and he or she has not shook hands with any of the other not shook hands with any of the other not shook hands with any of the other people okay one clearly has had a people okay one clearly has had a
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,13:45,13:55,people okay one clearly has had a handshake involving eight and since all handshake involving eight and since all handshake involving eight and since all these handshakes are accounted for we these handshakes are accounted for we these handshakes are accounted for we know that he has not shook hands with
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,13:55,14:03,know that he has not shook hands with know that he has not shook hands with anybody else that is here we have a anybody else that is here we have a anybody else that is here we have a person who has had seven handshakes the person who has had seven handshakes the
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,14:03,14:16,person who has had seven handshakes the seven handshake person would have three seven handshake person would have three seven handshake person would have three people with he with whom he has not had people with he with whom he has not had people with he with whom he has not had a handshake right one of those people is
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,14:16,14:23,a handshake right one of those people is a handshake right one of those people is a zero handshake person the other is a zero handshake person the other is a zero handshake person the other is himself or herself who was a third himself or herself who was a third
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,14:23,14:34,himself or herself who was a third person zero is not the spouse of seven person zero is not the spouse of seven person zero is not the spouse of seven there is a another person with whom there is a another person with whom there is a another person with whom seven has not had a handshake with okay
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,14:34,14:40,seven has not had a handshake with okay seven has not had a handshake with okay now if you look at one has only now if you look at one has only now if you look at one has only handshake is with eight and so seven has handshake is with eight and so seven has
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,14:40,14:51,handshake is with eight and so seven has not had a handshake with what that is not had a handshake with what that is not had a handshake with what that is clear clear clear moreover seven has had handshake with moreover seven has had handshake with moreover seven has had handshake with every other people in other words seven
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,14:51,15:11,every other people in other words seven every other people in other words seven has not shook hands with zero one and has not shook hands with zero one and has not shook hands with zero one and seven okay so zero one and seven have seven okay so zero one and seven have
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,15:11,15:19,seven okay so zero one and seven have not are not involved in a handshake not are not involved in a handshake not are not involved in a handshake involving seven so the others cannot be involving seven so the others cannot be involving seven so the others cannot be seventh spouse okay pseudo subtly is not
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,15:19,15:30,seventh spouse okay pseudo subtly is not seventh spouse okay pseudo subtly is not spouse of seven seven is also not the spouse of seven seven is also not the spouse of seven seven is also not the spouse of so and one are a couple spouse of so and one are a couple
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,15:30,15:35,spouse of so and one are a couple can recurse on this logic and usually we can recurse on this logic and usually we can recurse on this logic and usually we can conclude that six and two are a can conclude that six and two are a can conclude that six and two are a couple
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,15:35,15:47,couple couple and five and three are also a couple now and five and three are also a couple now and five and three are also a couple now after all these four couples have been after all these four couples have been after all these four couples have been accounted for what is remaining as m one
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,15:47,15:56,accounted for what is remaining as m one accounted for what is remaining as m one and four okay they must be a couple and and four okay they must be a couple and and four okay they must be a couple and the question that we started off with
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,15:56,16:03,the question that we started off with the question that we started off with was how many hands did m ones partner was how many hands did m ones partner was how many hands did m ones partner shake and the answer clearly is four shake and the answer clearly is four

210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,16:14,16:19,nutshell what we looked at this is we nutshell what we looked at this is we constructed a graph where there is an constructed a graph where there is an constructed a graph where there is an edge between two vertices they had shook edge between two vertices they had shook
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,16:19,16:27,edge between two vertices they had shook hands with each other they had a hands with each other they had a hands with each other they had a handshake handshake handshake once we constructed this graph we could once we constructed this graph we could once we constructed this graph we could pair off couples and once we paired off
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,16:27,16:34,pair off couples and once we paired off pair off couples and once we paired off couples what remained was m one and the couples what remained was m one and the couples what remained was m one and the person who has shook four hands and person who has shook four hands and
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,16:34,16:41,person who has shook four hands and therefore m one spot and that person is therefore m one spot and that person is therefore m one spot and that person is going to be a mans partner that helps going to be a mans partner that helps going to be a mans partner that helps us determine the number of handshakes
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,16:41,16:51,us determine the number of handshakes us determine the number of handshakes that m ones partner has exchanged so we that m ones partner has exchanged so we that m ones partner has exchanged so we saw about we saw graphs and we saw in an saw about we saw graphs and we saw in an
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,16:51,17:06,saw about we saw graphs and we saw in an interesting problem involving graphs now interesting problem involving graphs now interesting problem involving graphs now let us look at this problem of when are let us look at this problem of when are let us look at this problem of when are two graphs equal once we define a
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,17:06,17:14,two graphs equal once we define a two graphs equal once we define a mathematical structure we want to tell mathematical structure we want to tell mathematical structure we want to tell when are these two mathematical when are these two mathematical when are these two mathematical structures same and the notion is that
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,17:14,17:40,structures same and the notion is that structures same and the notion is that of isomorphism if we had a graph of this kind so these if we had a graph of this kind so these are vertex amp and another graph where the vertices are named a b c and d
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,17:40,17:50,where the vertices are named a b c and d they are essentially same object so this they are essentially same object so this they are essentially same object so this is a notion that we want to capture in is a notion that we want to capture in is a notion that we want to capture in terms of isomorphism so these are equal
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,17:50,18:01,terms of isomorphism so these are equal terms of isomorphism so these are equal and thats not equal to lets say amp and thats not equal to lets say amp and thats not equal to lets say amp ok so this is the notion that we want ok so this is the notion that we want
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,18:01,18:22,ok so this is the notion that we want to capture wire and isomorphism to capture wire and isomorphism to capture wire and isomorphism so lets provide a definition so let g so lets provide a definition so let g so lets provide a definition so let g be a graph only g and g g b graphs
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,18:22,18:38,and well assume that g is v comma e and well assume that g is v comma e so the vertex set is v and the edge so the vertex set is v and the edge so the vertex set is v and the edge set is even and for g we will assume

210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,18:56,19:12,if certain conditions hold okay the if certain conditions hold okay the first requirement is there should be a first requirement is there should be a first requirement is there should be a bisection between the word vertex sets bisection between the word vertex sets bisection between the word vertex sets for example in this example that we are
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,19:12,19:23,for example in this example that we are for example in this example that we are taken we could map to b to c to a taken we could map to b to c to a taken we could map to b to c to a d okay not only that once we have
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,19:23,19:30,d okay not only that once we have d okay not only that once we have mapped these the pair of vertices which mapped these the pair of vertices which mapped these the pair of vertices which had an edge i mean if you look at any had an edge i mean if you look at any
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,19:30,19:37,had an edge i mean if you look at any pair of vertices such that theres an pair of vertices such that theres an pair of vertices such that theres an edge between them if you look at the edge between them if you look at the edge between them if you look at the image there is an edge there as well
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,19:37,19:41,image there is an edge there as well image there is an edge there as well okay so if these two conditions are met okay so if these two conditions are met okay so if these two conditions are met then we will say that the graphs are then we will say that the graphs are
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,19:41,19:58,then we will say that the graphs are isomorphic lets quickly do one example isomorphic lets quickly do one example isomorphic lets quickly do one example if we had this particular graph okay if we had this particular graph okay if we had this particular graph okay note that we could map vertices to
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,19:58,20:05,note that we could map vertices to note that we could map vertices to each other the vertex in g could be each other the vertex in g could be each other the vertex in g could be mapped to vertex and g and so on but mapped to vertex and g and so on but
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,20:05,20:13,mapped to vertex and g and so on but if you do that there is an edge comma if you do that there is an edge comma if you do that there is an edge comma which is unaccounted for which is unaccounted for which is unaccounted for there is no i mean if you are trying to
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,20:13,20:18,there is no i mean if you are trying to there is no i mean if you are trying to map g g there is an edge between map g g there is an edge between map g g there is an edge between amp but there is no edge between the
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,20:18,20:32,amp but there is no edge between the amp but there is no edge between the images of amp images of amp images of amp ok so this is not an isomorphism so ok so this is not an isomorphism so ok so this is not an isomorphism so formally g is isomorphic to g if
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,20:32,21:01,from v so lets call this bisection f from v so lets call this bisection f from v to v okay so f maps v to v from v to v okay so f maps v to v from v to v okay so f maps v to v and the second condition is if a b a b
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,21:01,21:15,and the second condition is if a b a b and the second condition is if a b a b belongs to even implies and is implied belongs to even implies and is implied belongs to even implies and is implied by f of a f of b belongs to e okay so
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,21:15,21:21,by f of a f of b belongs to e okay so by f of a f of b belongs to e okay so this is the definition of isomorphism so this is the definition of isomorphism so this is the definition of isomorphism so basically we want to rename the vertices
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,21:21,21:27,basically we want to rename the vertices basically we want to rename the vertices in one graph by i mean you just want to in one graph by i mean you just want to in one graph by i mean you just want to rename the vertices in such a way that
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,21:27,21:33,rename the vertices in such a way that rename the vertices in such a way that if there is an edge between two vertices if there is an edge between two vertices if there is an edge between two vertices then the renaming also preserves that then the renaming also preserves that
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,21:33,21:44,then the renaming also preserves that edge and further if there is an edge in edge and further if there is an edge in edge and further if there is an edge in the renaming then when you recompute or the renaming then when you recompute or the renaming then when you recompute or look at the back image the graph should
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,21:44,21:49,look at the back image the graph should look at the back image the graph should have an edge there as well this have an edge there as well this have an edge there as well this condition is met then we will say that condition is met then we will say that
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,21:49,22:00,condition is met then we will say that the graphs are isomorphic so lets see a the graphs are isomorphic so lets see a the graphs are isomorphic so lets see a couple of examples of graphs so couple of examples of graphs so couple of examples of graphs so determining whether two graphs are
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,22:00,22:09,determining whether two graphs are determining whether two graphs are isomorphic thats a difficult question isomorphic thats a difficult question isomorphic thats a difficult question lets see some examples to understand lets see some examples to understand lets see some examples to understand why this might be difficult so let me
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,22:09,22:15,why this might be difficult so let me why this might be difficult so let me consider the construct couple of graphs consider the construct couple of graphs consider the construct couple of graphs and you can ponder about it whether and you can ponder about it whether and you can ponder about it whether these graphs are actually isomorphic or
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,22:15,22:42,these graphs are actually isomorphic or these graphs are actually isomorphic or not so this graph has six vertices so this graph has six vertices there are nine edges here three for the there are nine edges here three for the outer triangle three for the inner outer triangle three for the inner
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,22:42,22:55,outer triangle three for the inner triangles and three connecting them and triangles and three connecting them and triangles and three connecting them and here also there are nine edges so three here also there are nine edges so three here also there are nine edges so three vertex nine edge graph there are two of
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,22:55,23:07,vertex nine edge graph there are two of vertex nine edge graph there are two of them its drawn here now are these them its drawn here now are these them its drawn here now are these graphs isomorphic we can argue that graphs isomorphic we can argue that graphs isomorphic we can argue that these are not isomorphic because if you
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,23:07,23:15,these are not isomorphic because if you these are not isomorphic because if you take when there is in graph one there is take when there is in graph one there is take when there is in graph one there is a triangle it means there is a a triangle it means there is a
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,23:15,23:23,a triangle it means there is a collection of vertices such that they collection of vertices such that they collection of vertices such that they are all adjacent to each other theres a are all adjacent to each other theres a are all adjacent to each other theres a collection of three vertices are all
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,23:23,23:33,collection of three vertices are all collection of three vertices are all adjacent to each other whereas in the adjacent to each other whereas in the adjacent to each other whereas in the graph in graph two no two vertices have graph in graph two no two vertices have graph in graph two no two vertices have and if you take any two vertices which
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,23:33,23:39,and if you take any two vertices which and if you take any two vertices which are connected they never have a common are connected they never have a common are connected they never have a common neighbor so you look at one and two they neighbor so you look at one and two they
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,23:39,23:46,neighbor so you look at one and two they are connected and they dont have a are connected and they dont have a are connected and they dont have a common neighbor and that takes care of common neighbor and that takes care of common neighbor and that takes care of by symmetry if you look at one and two
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,23:46,23:53,by symmetry if you look at one and two by symmetry if you look at one and two that takes care of a lot of edges like that takes care of a lot of edges like that takes care of a lot of edges like etc amp are not taken
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,23:53,23:59,etc amp are not taken etc amp are not taken care of if you look at amp thats the care of if you look at amp thats the care of if you look at amp thats the other kind of edge they also dont have other kind of edge they also dont have
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,23:59,24:14,other kind of edge they also dont have a common neighbor so that takes care of a common neighbor so that takes care of a common neighbor so that takes care of the entire graph so we can argue that the entire graph so we can argue that the entire graph so we can argue that these graphs are not isomorphic so it is
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,24:14,24:20,these graphs are not isomorphic so it is these graphs are not isomorphic so it is tricky to find the reason for why tricky to find the reason for why tricky to find the reason for why certain pair of graphs may be non certain pair of graphs may be non
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,24:20,24:47,certain pair of graphs may be non isomorphic lets take a couple of other isomorphic lets take a couple of other isomorphic lets take a couple of other examples so heres a graph okay so this is a graph and think of it okay so this is a graph and think of it as a cube with eight vertices and here
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,24:47,25:14,as a cube with eight vertices and here as a cube with eight vertices and here is another graph with eight vertices so lets call this graph and graph so lets call this graph and graph are these graphs isomorphic in fact they are these graphs isomorphic in fact they
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,25:14,25:20,are these graphs isomorphic in fact they are and you can think of them as say as are and you can think of them as say as are and you can think of them as say as the same they are the same objects the same they are the same objects
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,25:20,25:28,the same they are the same objects mathematically so if you think of this mathematically so if you think of this mathematically so if you think of this is a b c d e gh you can map these is a b c d e gh you can map these
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,25:28,25:37,is a b c d e gh you can map these numbers in such a way that the edges are numbers in such a way that the edges are numbers in such a way that the edges are preserved across the map you can think preserved across the map you can think
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,25:37,25:53,preserved across the map you can think of a b c d as and the f g h rs of a b c d as and the f g h rs of a b c d as and the f g h rs so this is your a b ok you have to be
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,25:53,26:08,so this is your a b ok you have to be so this is your a b ok you have to be careful while you write the map a g is careful while you write the map a g is careful while you write the map a g is an edge so this is it is b is c is
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,26:08,26:24,an edge so this is it is b is c is an edge so this is it is b is c is d is for g has to be h has to be d is for g has to be h has to be d is for g has to be h has to be seven f has to be and e has to be so
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,26:24,26:34,seven f has to be and e has to be so seven f has to be and e has to be so you can look at this map so this map is you can look at this map so this map is you can look at this map so this map is an isomorphism between these two graphs
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,26:34,26:42,an isomorphism between these two graphs an isomorphism between these two graphs ok so the cube if it is laid out flat on ok so the cube if it is laid out flat on ok so the cube if it is laid out flat on a plane you will get something like this
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,26:42,26:54,a plane you will get something like this a plane you will get something like this and that placement essentially preserves and that placement essentially preserves and that placement essentially preserves the edges and therefore we can argue the edges and therefore we can argue the edges and therefore we can argue that theyre isomorphic now so these
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,26:54,26:58,that theyre isomorphic now so these that theyre isomorphic now so these examples it more or less they look like examples it more or less they look like examples it more or less they look like different graphs let me give you yet different graphs let me give you yet
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,26:58,27:05,different graphs let me give you yet another example where its not another example where its not another example where its not straightforward that the graphs are straightforward that the graphs are straightforward that the graphs are isomorphic are are or are not eyed isomorphic are are or are not eyed
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,27:05,27:45,isomorphic are are or are not eyed isomorphic so this is special graphs isomorphic so this is special graphs isomorphic so this is special graphs called as peterson graph so this is the peterson graph there are so this is the peterson graph there are vertices and the outer pentagon has five edges
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,27:45,27:55,and the outer pentagon has five edges the inner star also has five edges and the inner star also has five edges and the inner star also has five edges and then there are these connecting edges then there are these connecting edges then there are these connecting edges are five of them so this is a ten vertex
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,27:55,28:07,are five of them so this is a ten vertex are five of them so this is a ten vertex eds graph lets call this is three eds graph lets call this is three eds graph lets call this is three one and i will draw another graph think one and i will draw another graph think
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,28:07,28:29,one and i will draw another graph think about whether these graphs are about whether these graphs are about whether these graphs are isomorphic so i have one two three four isomorphic so i have one two three four isomorphic so i have one two three four five six seven eight nine vertices
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,28:29,28:44,and then there is one vertex in the and then there is one vertex in the center so this is also a vertex graph center so this is also a vertex graph center so this is also a vertex graph and the connections are as follows so and the connections are as follows so
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,28:44,28:54,and the connections are as follows so this is also nicely symmetric graph so this is also nicely symmetric graph so this is also nicely symmetric graph so between the center vertex is there and between the center vertex is there and between the center vertex is there and then in between each of these spokes
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,28:54,29:11,then in between each of these spokes then in between each of these spokes that are precisely two other vertices that are precisely two other vertices that are precisely two other vertices and then this vertex is connected to and then this vertex is connected to and then this vertex is connected to this vertex these vertices are connected
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,29:11,29:24,this vertex these vertices are connected this vertex these vertices are connected and these what x vertices are also and these what x vertices are also and these what x vertices are also connected okay so this is another graph connected okay so this is another graph connected okay so this is another graph again the outer circle cycle has nine
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,29:24,29:41,again the outer circle cycle has nine again the outer circle cycle has nine edges plus there are three spokes and edges plus there are three spokes and edges plus there are three spokes and then there are three of these cross then there are three of these cross then there are three of these cross edges so there is a total of edges
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,29:41,30:01,now are these graphs isomorphic as z now are these graphs isomorphic as z and z isomorphic can you somehow twist and z isomorphic can you somehow twist and z isomorphic can you somehow twist the graph z or z and get something i the graph z or z and get something i
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,30:01,30:11,the graph z or z and get something i mean and get the other graph okay twist mean and get the other graph okay twist mean and get the other graph okay twist z and get g is it possible so we can z and get g is it possible so we can
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,30:11,30:19,z and get g is it possible so we can show that they are isomorphic so let us show that they are isomorphic so let us show that they are isomorphic so let us fix an isomorphism so we will name these fix an isomorphism so we will name these
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,30:19,30:45,fix an isomorphism so we will name these vertices as a b c d e and a b c d e so let me just call this as a b c d and so let me just call this as a b c d and e okay clearly there is a cycle
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,30:45,30:52,e okay clearly there is a cycle e okay clearly there is a cycle involving there and then so if you think involving there and then so if you think involving there and then so if you think of that as the outer circle the other of that as the outer circle the other
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,30:52,31:12,of that as the outer circle the other vertices should form an inner cycle this vertices should form an inner cycle this vertices should form an inner cycle this if i call it as a so a is connected to c and c is so a is connected to c and c is connected to so a c c is going to ii
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,31:12,31:38,connected to so a c c is going to ii connected to so a c c is going to ii and e is connected to b and b is and e is connected to b and b is and e is connected to b and b is connected to and d is connected to a so we can
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,31:38,31:45,and d is connected to a so we can draw that as a we can think of that as draw that as a we can think of that as draw that as a we can think of that as the other cycle we need to have the the other cycle we need to have the
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,31:45,32:14,the other cycle we need to have the other psyche you need to c c to e you want to b b to d and d to a you want to b b to d and d to a and the other cycle was this and you and the other cycle was this and you
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,32:14,32:28,and the other cycle was this and you can see that the corresponding edges e can see that the corresponding edges e can see that the corresponding edges e e b b c c a a and e b e b b c c a a and e b e b b c c a a and e b they are also present okay so its not
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,32:28,32:33,they are also present okay so its not they are also present okay so its not easy to transform all the others to give easy to transform all the others to give easy to transform all the others to give the other one but you can see that all the other one but you can see that all
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,32:33,32:38,the other one but you can see that all the if you map it like this all the edge the if you map it like this all the edge the if you map it like this all the edge relations are essentially taken care of relations are essentially taken care of
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,32:38,32:45,relations are essentially taken care of so the drawings of the graphs may look so the drawings of the graphs may look so the drawings of the graphs may look different but there they could still be different but there they could still be different but there they could still be isomorphic
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,32:45,32:54,isomorphic isomorphic okay so peterson graph is an example of okay so peterson graph is an example of okay so peterson graph is an example of a so these are two examples which are a so these are two examples which are a so these are two examples which are two representations of the same graph

210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,36:04,36:10,length three but if this is not a regular graph so this kind of graphs is regular graph so this kind of graphs is regular graph so this kind of graphs is an example of what is a regular graph an example of what is a regular graph an example of what is a regular graph and if it were not of this kind for
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,36:10,36:18,and if it were not of this kind for and if it were not of this kind for example if you had another vertex lets example if you had another vertex lets example if you had another vertex lets call this a z then there will be an call this a z then there will be an
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,36:18,36:25,call this a z then there will be an entry corresponding to z and that is entry corresponding to z and that is entry corresponding to z and that is connected to only dnc and if you look at connected to only dnc and if you look at connected to only dnc and if you look at d and c there will be these entries
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,36:25,36:32,d and c there will be these entries d and c there will be these entries corresponding to z so this is not a corresponding to z so this is not a corresponding to z so this is not a symmetric one as the previous one so symmetric one as the previous one so
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,36:32,36:37,symmetric one as the previous one so this is the adjacency list this is the adjacency list this is the adjacency list representation so when you talk about representation so when you talk about representation so when you talk about the adjacency list representation for the adjacency list representation for
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,36:37,36:46,the adjacency list representation for every vertex the you have a list telling every vertex the you have a list telling every vertex the you have a list telling which all are the other edges which have which all are the other edges which have which all are the other edges which have which share an edge with this particular
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,36:46,36:56,which share an edge with this particular which share an edge with this particular vertex and the sensi matrix vertex and the sensi matrix vertex and the sensi matrix representation is a slightly different representation is a slightly different representation is a slightly different one so here you represent the entire
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,36:56,37:08,one so here you represent the entire one so here you represent the entire information in terms of a matrix so a information in terms of a matrix so a information in terms of a matrix so a b c d e and a b c d e so if were

210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,37:54,38:00,comma as entries so the ij entry so comma as entries so the ij entry so if you call the matrix as a and a ij as if you call the matrix as a and a ij as if you call the matrix as a and a ij as the ij entry this is equal to if and
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,38:00,38:10,the ij entry this is equal to if and the ij entry this is equal to if and only if i comma j is an edge in g so only if i comma j is an edge in g so only if i comma j is an edge in g so clearly every graph will have a unique

210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,39:06,39:29,something called as its degree degree of something called as its degree degree of vertices so this is simply defined as the number so this is simply defined as the number of edges sharing a vertex okay so degree of edges sharing a vertex okay so degree of edges sharing a vertex okay so degree is defined for a particular word vertex
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,39:29,39:38,is defined for a particular word vertex is defined for a particular word vertex so its denoted usually by delta so so its denoted usually by delta so so its denoted usually by delta so delta v is equal to number of edges delta v is equal to number of edges
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,39:38,39:49,delta v is equal to number of edges involving v so if you look at the if you involving v so if you look at the if you involving v so if you look at the if you look at this graph the degree of vertex look at this graph the degree of vertex
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,39:49,40:06,look at this graph the degree of vertex one is going to be one two and three one is going to be one two and three one is going to be one two and three whereas degree of vertex four is two and degree of two is going to be three
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,40:06,40:17,degree of two is going to be three degree of five is going to be two and degree of five is going to be two and degree of five is going to be two and the degree of three is again with two to the degree of three is again with two to
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,40:17,40:27,the degree of three is again with two to add them up what you will get in this add them up what you will get in this add them up what you will get in this case is ten sorry twelve and this turns case is ten sorry twelve and this turns
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,40:27,40:34,case is ten sorry twelve and this turns out to be two times the number of edges out to be two times the number of edges out to be two times the number of edges so that we will state as a theorem so so that we will state as a theorem so
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,40:34,40:42,so that we will state as a theorem so its not particular to this particular its not particular to this particular its not particular to this particular graph in any graph if you look at the graph in any graph if you look at the graph in any graph if you look at the degree of each vertex and sum it up over
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,40:42,41:12,degree of each vertex and sum it up over degree of each vertex and sum it up over all the vertices you will get twice the all the vertices you will get twice the all the vertices you will get twice the number of edges summation over we belonging to vertex
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,41:12,41:19,summation over we belonging to vertex set delta v is going to be equal to two set delta v is going to be equal to two set delta v is going to be equal to two times the number of edges proof is times the number of edges proof is
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,41:19,41:29,times the number of edges proof is straightforward let us look at each straightforward let us look at each straightforward let us look at each vertex and look at how many outgoing vertex and look at how many outgoing vertex and look at how many outgoing edges are there add it up thats the
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,41:29,41:49,edges are there add it up thats the edges are there add it up thats the quantity on lhs so the lefthand side is quantity on lhs so the lefthand side is quantity on lhs so the lefthand side is equal to sum over some of delta v over each vertex so each
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,41:49,41:56,some of delta v over each vertex so each vertex you are looking at the number of vertex you are looking at the number of vertex you are looking at the number of edges at that particular vertex now if edges at that particular vertex now if edges at that particular vertex now if you think about this particular
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,41:56,42:06,you think about this particular you think about this particular summation if you look at any particular summation if you look at any particular summation if you look at any particular edge each edge is being counted edge each edge is being counted edge each edge is being counted precisely twice so if you look at any
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,42:06,42:16,precisely twice so if you look at any precisely twice so if you look at any particular edge say between a vertex u particular edge say between a vertex u particular edge say between a vertex u and v then you are computing delta u and v then you are computing delta u
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,42:16,42:27,and v then you are computing delta u this edge you can tick it once and this edge you can tick it once and this edge you can tick it once and whenever you are counting delta v you whenever you are counting delta v you whenever you are counting delta v you can take it again okay so what were
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,42:27,42:31,can take it again okay so what were can take it again okay so what were suggesting is the following when we are suggesting is the following when we are suggesting is the following when we are doing this counting over every vertex we doing this counting over every vertex we
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,42:31,42:38,doing this counting over every vertex we just look at all the outgoing edges at just look at all the outgoing edges at just look at all the outgoing edges at one particular vertex and whenever it is one particular vertex and whenever it is one particular vertex and whenever it is counted we will just stick on those
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,42:38,42:47,counted we will just stick on those counted we will just stick on those vertices now if we have summed up over vertices now if we have summed up over vertices now if we have summed up over every vertex you will note that each i every vertex you will note that each i
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,42:47,42:55,every vertex you will note that each i just stick texas just stick texas just stick texas one for each of its endpoints okay so one for each of its endpoints okay so one for each of its endpoints okay so every vertex would have been picked every vertex would have been picked
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,42:55,43:04,every vertex would have been picked exactly twice and sorry every edge would exactly twice and sorry every edge would exactly twice and sorry every edge would have been picked exactly twice so total have been picked exactly twice so total have been picked exactly twice so total number of ticks that you put by one
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,43:04,43:10,number of ticks that you put by one number of ticks that you put by one count it is going to be summation over v count it is going to be summation over v count it is going to be summation over v delta v and since every edges take
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,43:10,43:16,delta v and since every edges take delta v and since every edges take exactly twice the total number of pigs exactly twice the total number of pigs exactly twice the total number of pigs is just two times number of edges so is just two times number of edges so
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,43:16,43:25,is just two times number of edges so that is the proof a graph will have some that is the proof a graph will have some that is the proof a graph will have some definitions which we will use later we definitions which we will use later we definitions which we will use later we talked about regular or regularity when
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,43:25,43:33,talked about regular or regularity when talked about regular or regularity when we talked about the peterson graph so we we talked about the peterson graph so we we talked about the peterson graph so we will call a graph as regular if every will call a graph as regular if every
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,43:33,43:49,will call a graph as regular if every vertex has the same degree so if you vertex has the same degree so if you vertex has the same degree so if you look at and look at this particular look at and look at this particular look at and look at this particular graph of the cycle this is a regular
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,43:49,44:03,graph of the cycle this is a regular graph of the cycle this is a regular graph because every vertex has degree graph because every vertex has degree graph because every vertex has degree you could also take the complete graph so here every vertex is connected to so here every vertex is connected to every other vertex and delta b is equal
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,44:03,44:11,every other vertex and delta b is equal every other vertex and delta b is equal to four for all we take any vertex its to four for all we take any vertex its to four for all we take any vertex its degree is going to be four so thats the
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,44:11,44:25,degree is going to be four so thats the degree is going to be four so thats the notion of regularity lets introduce notion of regularity lets introduce notion of regularity lets introduce some more terms some more basic terms in some more terms some more basic terms in some more terms some more basic terms in graph theory we will learn about walks
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,44:25,44:38,graph theory we will learn about walks graph theory we will learn about walks paths and cycles so walk is the easiest paths and cycles so walk is the easiest paths and cycles so walk is the easiest to describe a walk is just a sequence of to describe a walk is just a sequence of
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,44:38,44:58,to describe a walk is just a sequence of vertices such that between the vertices such that between the vertices such that between the consecutive vertices there is an edge so consecutive vertices there is an edge so consecutive vertices there is an edge so a walk is a sequence of vertices so if
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,44:58,45:03,a walk is a sequence of vertices so if a walk is a sequence of vertices so if you are given a particular graph a walk you are given a particular graph a walk you are given a particular graph a walk in that particular graph okay so not in that particular graph okay so not
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,45:03,45:14,in that particular graph okay so not written it down but thats what we mean written it down but thats what we mean written it down but thats what we mean a walk in a graph is a sequence of a walk in a graph is a sequence of a walk in a graph is a sequence of vertices v v the are some of these
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,45:14,45:29,vertices v v the are some of these vertices v v the are some of these vertices could be a repeating doesnt vertices could be a repeating doesnt vertices could be a repeating doesnt matter but the only requirement is for matter but the only requirement is for matter but the only requirement is for every valid i v i vi plus is an edge
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,45:29,45:36,every valid i v i vi plus is an edge every valid i v i vi plus is an edge in the graph ok so i can range from when in the graph ok so i can range from when in the graph ok so i can range from when we say valid i i can range from to r
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,45:36,45:41,we say valid i i can range from to r we say valid i i can range from to r minus so thats going to be called as minus so thats going to be called as minus so thats going to be called as a walk a walk is just a sequence of
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,45:41,45:52,a walk a walk is just a sequence of a walk a walk is just a sequence of vertices such that between adjacent vertices such that between adjacent vertices such that between adjacent vertices there is a between vertices vertices there is a between vertices vertices there is a between vertices adjacent and adjacent in the sequence
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,45:52,46:08,adjacent and adjacent in the sequence adjacent and adjacent in the sequence theres an edge so if this was our graph okay if you take one two three one two okay if you take one two three one two three between one and two thousand heads three between one and two thousand heads
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,46:08,46:17,three between one and two thousand heads between three and two thousand heads but between three and two thousand heads but between three and two thousand heads but between three and onethird is no edge between three and onethird is no edge between three and onethird is no edge so this is not a walk whereas if you
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,46:17,46:25,so this is not a walk whereas if you so this is not a walk whereas if you take one two six three two six five four take one two six three two six five four take one two six three two six five four okay you can verify that thats a walk
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,46:25,46:38,okay you can verify that thats a walk okay you can verify that thats a walk let walk is just nothing but the one let walk is just nothing but the one let walk is just nothing but the one indicated by this particular red line okay so note that in this second walk
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,46:38,46:47,okay so note that in this second walk that we have written there are repeated that we have written there are repeated that we have written there are repeated vertices a walk without repeated vertices a walk without repeated vertices a walk without repeated vertices is going to be called as a path
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,46:47,47:08,vertices is going to be called as a path vertices is going to be called as a path okay so that gives us the next okay so that gives us the next okay so that gives us the next definition apart there is a walk without repeated vertices so in our graph of n
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,47:08,47:23,repeated vertices so in our graph of n vertices the longest path can have at vertices the longest path can have at vertices the longest path can have at most and can have n vertices in it so if most and can have n vertices in it so if most and can have n vertices in it so if you take one two three four five six
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,47:23,47:32,you take one two three four five six you take one two three four five six thats a path if you take one two six thats a path if you take one two six thats a path if you take one two six three five four that is also a path and
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,47:32,47:36,three five four that is also a path and three five four that is also a path and this path will have five edges in it this path will have five edges in it this path will have five edges in it okay so weve learnt what is a walk and
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,47:36,47:58,okay so weve learnt what is a walk and okay so weve learnt what is a walk and what is a path and the next thing is what is a path and the next thing is what is a path and the next thing is what is a cycle the cycle is a walk where the first and
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,47:58,48:25,the cycle is a walk where the first and last vertices are the same and no other last vertices are the same and no other last vertices are the same and no other vertices repeat ok natural to call it as vertices repeat ok natural to call it as vertices repeat ok natural to call it as a psyche if we have taken ok
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,48:25,48:40,a psyche if we have taken ok a psyche if we have taken ok in this particular graph so in this particular graph so in this particular graph so thats going to be a cycling so no thats going to be a cycling so no thats going to be a cycling so no vertex repeats other than the first
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,48:40,48:47,vertex repeats other than the first vertex repeats other than the first tenth last so in some textbooks we will tenth last so in some textbooks we will tenth last so in some textbooks we will see that the last vertex is not see that the last vertex is not
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,48:47,48:55,see that the last vertex is not explicitly mentioned and we will think explicitly mentioned and we will think explicitly mentioned and we will think about the cycle involving those we will about the cycle involving those we will about the cycle involving those we will just assume that the last vertex in the
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,48:55,48:59,just assume that the last vertex in the just assume that the last vertex in the first vertex are connected but for this first vertex are connected but for this first vertex are connected but for this course when we say cycle we will just course when we say cycle we will just
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,48:59,49:08,course when we say cycle we will just list out all the vertices in the path list out all the vertices in the path list out all the vertices in the path including the repeated once the first in including the repeated once the first in including the repeated once the first in the last one are the repeated ones so
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,49:08,49:22,the last one are the repeated ones so the last one are the repeated ones so thats a cycle now lets describe some more special kind of lets describe some more special kind of cycles two types of cycles that we will cycles two types of cycles that we will
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,49:22,49:38,cycles two types of cycles that we will introduce one is something called as an introduce one is something called as an introduce one is something called as an euler ians cycle the other is called as euler ians cycle the other is called as euler ians cycle the other is called as a hamiltonian cycle
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,49:38,49:53,this can also refer to this as the euler this can also refer to this as the euler aryan circuit okay so this is in the strict sense you okay so this is in the strict sense you cant think of this as a cycle because cant think of this as a cycle because
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,49:53,50:02,cant think of this as a cycle because word is this repeat okay so euler in word is this repeat okay so euler in word is this repeat okay so euler in cycle is not a cycle in this sense of cycle is not a cycle in this sense of
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,50:02,50:12,cycle is not a cycle in this sense of vertex vertices is not repeating okay vertex vertices is not repeating okay vertex vertices is not repeating okay but what but it will be a walk but what but it will be a walk but what but it will be a walk so either answer circuit is a walk which
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,50:12,50:18,so either answer circuit is a walk which so either answer circuit is a walk which starts at some particular vertex and starts at some particular vertex and starts at some particular vertex and ends back at a particular vertex okay so ends back at a particular vertex okay so
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,50:18,50:50,ends back at a particular vertex okay so we will formally define an euler in we will formally define an euler in we will formally define an euler in cycle is a walk where the first and last cycle is a walk where the first and last cycle is a walk where the first and last vertices are the same this is the first
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,50:50,51:02,vertices are the same this is the first vertices are the same this is the first requirement first and last vertices are requirement first and last vertices are requirement first and last vertices are the same thats the notion of sightly the same thats the notion of sightly the same thats the notion of sightly the second condition is no edges repeat
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,51:02,51:06,the second condition is no edges repeat the second condition is no edges repeat okay what does it mean for edges to okay what does it mean for edges to okay what does it mean for edges to repeat after all and well think of a repeat after all and well think of a
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,51:06,51:17,repeat after all and well think of a walk we have all these sequence of walk we have all these sequence of walk we have all these sequence of vertices between any two vertices so vi vertices between any two vertices so vi vertices between any two vertices so vi and vi plus one we have an edge so you
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,51:17,51:22,and vi plus one we have an edge so you and vi plus one we have an edge so you can think of an edge appearing there and can think of an edge appearing there and can think of an edge appearing there and if you look at the sequence of edges
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,51:22,51:28,if you look at the sequence of edges if you look at the sequence of edges that are being present in the work none that are being present in the work none that are being present in the work none of those that just repeat and the third of those that just repeat and the third
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,51:28,51:51,of those that just repeat and the third requirement the crucial one is that requirement the crucial one is that requirement the crucial one is that every edge in the graph appears every edge in the graph appears every edge in the graph appears at least once okay so the oil so what it
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,51:51,51:57,at least once okay so the oil so what it at least once okay so the oil so what it means for a graph to be euler ian is the means for a graph to be euler ian is the means for a graph to be euler ian is the graph has an euler in cycle then we say
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,51:57,52:06,graph has an euler in cycle then we say graph has an euler in cycle then we say that the graph is euler here there is that the graph is euler here there is that the graph is euler here there is also a notion of euler in path where all
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,52:06,52:16,also a notion of euler in path where all also a notion of euler in path where all these conditions should be met but the these conditions should be met but the these conditions should be met but the first and last vertices we will relax first and last vertices we will relax
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,52:16,52:25,first and last vertices we will relax this condition that the first in the this condition that the first in the this condition that the first in the last vertices are the same okay so if last vertices are the same okay so if last vertices are the same okay so if just this condition one is exempted then
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,52:25,52:30,just this condition one is exempted then just this condition one is exempted then we will say that what is the resulting we will say that what is the resulting we will say that what is the resulting is an euler en path okay so now the is an euler en path okay so now the
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,52:30,52:38,is an euler en path okay so now the question is given a graph does the graph question is given a graph does the graph question is given a graph does the graph has an euler arian cycle has an euler arian cycle has an euler arian cycle so this problem was investigated by the
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,52:38,53:00,so this problem was investigated by the so this problem was investigated by the great mathematician euler so euler great mathematician euler so euler great mathematician euler so euler basically looked at what is now known as basically looked at what is now known as basically looked at what is now known as the konigsberg bridge problem
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,53:00,53:18,okay so this is a the problem was okay so this is a the problem was initially posed in the following way this is a river and there are two river this is a river and there are two river islands then there is a bridge to either islands then there is a bridge to either
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,53:18,53:29,islands then there is a bridge to either banks there are two bridges to either banks there are two bridges to either banks there are two bridges to either banks from this island one and from banks from this island one and from banks from this island one and from island lets call this is a and from
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,53:29,53:39,island lets call this is a and from island lets call this is a and from island b there are bridges to either of island b there are bridges to either of island b there are bridges to either of the banks so this is the river and there the banks so this is the river and there
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,53:39,53:48,the banks so this is the river and there is a bridge connecting the islands now is a bridge connecting the islands now is a bridge connecting the islands now the question is can you start somewhere the question is can you start somewhere the question is can you start somewhere in one of the islands or on one of the
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,53:48,53:57,in one of the islands or on one of the in one of the islands or on one of the banks and then come back to the same banks and then come back to the same banks and then come back to the same place after visiting every after being
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,53:57,54:09,place after visiting every after being place after visiting every after being on every bridge at least once so can you on every bridge at least once so can you on every bridge at least once so can you start at a bank lets say this is bank c start at a bank lets say this is bank c
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,54:09,54:35,start at a bank lets say this is bank c and this is the other bank d so can you and this is the other bank d so can you and this is the other bank d so can you start at c and return to c after so also same as can you traverse this
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,54:35,54:53,so also same as can you traverse this without lifting your pencil and without without lifting your pencil and without without lifting your pencil and without redrawing anything okay so one attempt redrawing anything okay so one attempt redrawing anything okay so one attempt would be start from here go like this but when you reach here
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,54:53,55:04,go like this but when you reach here there is no way you can complete that there is no way you can complete that there is no way you can complete that particular circuit so that item does not particular circuit so that item does not particular circuit so that item does not work but does it mean that none of the
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,55:04,55:08,work but does it mean that none of the work but does it mean that none of the items are going to work so euler solve items are going to work so euler solve items are going to work so euler solve this problem and showed that this graph this problem and showed that this graph
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,55:08,55:15,this problem and showed that this graph cannot be traversed i mean this cannot be traversed i mean this cannot be traversed i mean this particular this is not yet a graph but particular this is not yet a graph but particular this is not yet a graph but this can be converted into a graph and
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,55:15,55:21,this can be converted into a graph and this can be converted into a graph and certain properties of that graph would certain properties of that graph would certain properties of that graph would imply that there are no way of solving imply that there are no way of solving
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,55:21,55:30,imply that there are no way of solving this particular problem so we will see this particular problem so we will see this particular problem so we will see that so when does a graph have an euler that so when does a graph have an euler that so when does a graph have an euler in cycle and when does a graph not have
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,55:30,55:51,in cycle and when does a graph not have in cycle and when does a graph not have euler in cycling so the following euler in cycling so the following euler in cycling so the following theorem characterizes it will write it theorem characterizes it will write it theorem characterizes it will write it as eulers theorem
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,55:51,56:09,one of the many many eulers theorems a one of the many many eulers theorems a graph is euler in that this it contains graph is euler in that this it contains graph is euler in that this it contains an euler insightly if and only if it is an euler insightly if and only if it is
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,56:09,56:26,an euler insightly if and only if it is connected thats a requirement what does connected thats a requirement what does connected thats a requirement what does it mean to be connected well see in a it mean to be connected well see in a it mean to be connected well see in a while and every vertex must have an even
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,56:26,56:47,while and every vertex must have an even while and every vertex must have an even degree okay so before we go into the proof okay so before we go into the proof lets define what is connected okay so lets define what is connected okay so lets define what is connected okay so lets look at all the vertices on the
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,56:47,56:56,lets look at all the vertices on the lets look at all the vertices on the graph and we can define a relationship graph and we can define a relationship graph and we can define a relationship so we will say x is related to y if so we will say x is related to y if
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,56:56,57:14,so we will say x is related to y if there is a path starting at x and ending there is a path starting at x and ending there is a path starting at x and ending at y okay for simplicity we can just at y okay for simplicity we can just
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,57:14,57:27,at y okay for simplicity we can just think of means we can replace the notion think of means we can replace the notion think of means we can replace the notion of path with a walk makes the proof of path with a walk makes the proof of path with a walk makes the proof simpler so walk means there could be
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,57:27,57:33,simpler so walk means there could be simpler so walk means there could be repeated vertices path means there are repeated vertices path means there are repeated vertices path means there are no repeated vertices if you had a walk no repeated vertices if you had a walk no repeated vertices if you had a walk you can need sleek and if there is such
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,57:33,57:38,you can need sleek and if there is such you can need sleek and if there is such a walk then you can just throw away the a walk then you can just throw away the a walk then you can just throw away the repeated vertices or the portion where
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,57:38,57:42,repeated vertices or the portion where repeated vertices or the portion where portion of the walk where the road is portion of the walk where the road is portion of the walk where the road is repeating and get a path okay but we repeating and get a path okay but we
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,57:42,57:50,repeating and get a path okay but we will just stick with the notion of walk will just stick with the notion of walk will just stick with the notion of walk for defining connected okay so this is a for defining connected okay so this is a for defining connected okay so this is a relationship between vertices now you
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,57:50,57:58,relationship between vertices now you relationship between vertices now you can see that this is a equivalence can see that this is a equivalence can see that this is a equivalence relation we will say that a vertex is relation we will say that a vertex is relation we will say that a vertex is automatically connected to itself so it
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,57:58,58:13,automatically connected to itself so it automatically connected to itself so it is reflexive by definition okay and it is reflexive by definition okay and it is reflexive by definition okay and it is transitive okay because if x is is transitive okay because if x is is transitive okay because if x is connected to y sorry and if y is
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,58:13,58:19,connected to y sorry and if y is connected to y sorry and if y is connected to z okay that means there is connected to z okay that means there is connected to z okay that means there is a path starting from x or there is a a path starting from x or there is a
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,58:19,58:26,a path starting from x or there is a walk starting from x to y and then there walk starting from x to y and then there walk starting from x to y and then there is another walk starting from y to z if is another walk starting from y to z if
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,58:26,58:36,is another walk starting from y to z if we join these if you just write the we join these if you just write the we join these if you just write the sequence one after another you will sequence one after another you will sequence one after another you will basically get a path from x to z okay so
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,58:36,58:42,basically get a path from x to z okay so basically get a path from x to z okay so this would imply that x and z are this would imply that x and z are this would imply that x and z are connected so reflexive transitive and it
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,58:42,58:48,connected so reflexive transitive and it connected so reflexive transitive and it is also symmetric if there is a path is also symmetric if there is a path is also symmetric if there is a path from x to y then that would imply that y from x to y then that would imply that y
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,58:48,58:53,from x to y then that would imply that y to x is also a path because you can just to x is also a path because you can just to x is also a path because you can just look at this look at this look at this but in the rivers okay so this
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,58:53,59:09,but in the rivers okay so this but in the rivers okay so this relationship is a is an equivalence relationship is a is an equivalence relationship is a is an equivalence relation so this is an equivalence relation so this is an equivalence relation so this is an equivalence relation as we know if you have an
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,59:09,59:14,relation as we know if you have an relation as we know if you have an equivalence relation on a set that set equivalence relation on a set that set equivalence relation on a set that set that induces a partition on the other that induces a partition on the other
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,59:14,59:29,that induces a partition on the other lying set and that partition if it has lying set and that partition if it has lying set and that partition if it has exactly one equivalence class so if the exactly one equivalence class so if the exactly one equivalence class so if the the equivalence relation partitions we
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,59:29,59:46,the equivalence relation partitions we the equivalence relation partitions we into a single class it means theres into a single class it means theres into a single class it means theres only one equivalence class then we say only one equivalence class then we say only one equivalence class then we say that g is connected so we defined when
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,59:46,59:53,that g is connected so we defined when that g is connected so we defined when up two vertices connected and that up two vertices connected and that up two vertices connected and that relation is basically an equivalence relation is basically an equivalence relation is basically an equivalence relation and that relation induces a
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,59:53,60:01,relation and that relation induces a relation and that relation induces a partition and if this partition had partition and if this partition had partition and if this partition had precisely one equivalence class then we precisely one equivalence class then we precisely one equivalence class then we will say that the graph is a connected
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,60:01,60:08,will say that the graph is a connected will say that the graph is a connected graph graph graph okay so eulers theorem states that if okay so eulers theorem states that if okay so eulers theorem states that if you take any graph which is connected you take any graph which is connected
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,60:08,60:20,you take any graph which is connected and if every vertex has even degree then and if every vertex has even degree then and if every vertex has even degree then the graph will have an euler aryan the graph will have an euler aryan the graph will have an euler aryan cycling okay well do the proof of this
210.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,60:20,60:48,cycling okay well do the proof of this cycling okay well do the proof of this in the next session stop here for today in the next session stop here for today in the next session stop here for today music
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,0:09,0:36,music music you music music you in the previous lecture we define the in the previous lecture we define the notion we introduced the notion of notion we introduced the notion of notion we introduced the notion of graphs and then we define when are two graphs and then we define when are two
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,0:36,0:48,graphs and then we define when are two graphs same we talked about what is the graphs same we talked about what is the graphs same we talked about what is the isomorphism between graphs and then we isomorphism between graphs and then we isomorphism between graphs and then we saw a theorem called as eulers theorem
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,0:48,1:02,saw a theorem called as eulers theorem saw a theorem called as eulers theorem we didnt prove this so that is the we didnt prove this so that is the we didnt prove this so that is the first thing that we will do today so oilers theorem states that a connected
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,1:02,1:35,oilers theorem states that a connected graph has an euler in circuit if and graph has an euler in circuit if and graph has an euler in circuit if and only if the degree of every vertex this only if the degree of every vertex this only if the degree of every vertex this even okay so euler in circuit was a walk
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,1:35,1:48,even okay so euler in circuit was a walk even okay so euler in circuit was a walk in the graph there in the graph there in the graph there no it just traversed twice debris edges no it just traversed twice debris edges no it just traversed twice debris edges traversed exactly once for example if we
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,1:48,1:56,traversed exactly once for example if we traversed exactly once for example if we consider the following graph this graph consider the following graph this graph consider the following graph this graph will not have an euler in circuit as per will not have an euler in circuit as per
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,1:56,2:03,will not have an euler in circuit as per the theorem because if you look at these the theorem because if you look at these the theorem because if you look at these vertices they all have degree but we vertices they all have degree but we vertices they all have degree but we can convert them into i mean if we
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,2:03,2:12,can convert them into i mean if we can convert them into i mean if we modify the graphs this particular graph modify the graphs this particular graph modify the graphs this particular graph this will have an euler in circuit this will have an euler in circuit this will have an euler in circuit because the degree of every vertex is
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,2:12,2:19,because the degree of every vertex is because the degree of every vertex is even and just writing down the degrees even and just writing down the degrees even and just writing down the degrees of the vertices so not the vertex labels of the vertices so not the vertex labels
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,2:19,2:28,of the vertices so not the vertex labels so this graph will surely have an euler so this graph will surely have an euler so this graph will surely have an euler in circuit and we will in fact construct in circuit and we will in fact construct in circuit and we will in fact construct one such and convert that into a that
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,2:28,2:39,one such and convert that into a that one such and convert that into a that construction into a proof so lets say construction into a proof so lets say construction into a proof so lets say we start from this particular vertex okay so if we vent about in this
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,2:39,2:48,okay so if we vent about in this particular fashion there are lots of particular fashion there are lots of particular fashion there are lots of edges which are not traversed you can edges which are not traversed you can edges which are not traversed you can separately look at them this is yet
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,2:48,2:58,separately look at them this is yet separately look at them this is yet another one so we drew this as we another one so we drew this as we another one so we drew this as we traversed this graph by means of three traversed this graph by means of three
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,2:58,3:08,traversed this graph by means of three cycles we could have done that more cycles we could have done that more cycles we could have done that more systematically you could have started systematically you could have started systematically you could have started from here and at this point we can just
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,3:08,3:15,from here and at this point we can just from here and at this point we can just come back here or again we can take this come back here or again we can take this come back here or again we can take this come back here and then do this okay so

211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,3:21,3:28,method by which we drew looked like method by which we drew looked like arbitrary which is arbitrarily trace the arbitrary which is arbitrarily trace the arbitrary which is arbitrarily trace the edges we can essentially convert that edges we can essentially convert that edges we can essentially convert that method into a proof of our theorem we
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,3:28,3:37,method into a proof of our theorem we method into a proof of our theorem we will do that first thing okay so the key will do that first thing okay so the key will do that first thing okay so the key idea is since every vertex has degree
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,3:37,3:44,idea is since every vertex has degree idea is since every vertex has degree even if you enter any vertex you have to even if you enter any vertex you have to even if you enter any vertex you have to obviously leave the vertex okay you will obviously leave the vertex okay you will
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,3:44,3:51,obviously leave the vertex okay you will never be stranded at any particular never be stranded at any particular never be stranded at any particular vertex so let us say we are randomly vertex so let us say we are randomly vertex so let us say we are randomly moving from one vertex to other we are
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,3:51,3:58,moving from one vertex to other we are moving from one vertex to other we are not being particularly clever about not being particularly clever about not being particularly clever about which is the outgoing edge for example which is the outgoing edge for example which is the outgoing edge for example if we come to this particular vertex
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,3:58,4:05,if we come to this particular vertex if we come to this particular vertex okay one of the edges have been used but okay one of the edges have been used but okay one of the edges have been used but the fact that the vertex has an even the fact that the vertex has an even
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,4:05,4:16,the fact that the vertex has an even degree means that there is at least one degree means that there is at least one degree means that there is at least one leaving edge okay so for every vertex if leaving edge okay so for every vertex if leaving edge okay so for every vertex if we start at any arbitrary vertex and
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,4:16,4:22,we start at any arbitrary vertex and we start at any arbitrary vertex and keep on moving that is tracing edges the keep on moving that is tracing edges the keep on moving that is tracing edges the only requirement or the only restriction only requirement or the only restriction
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,4:22,4:28,only requirement or the only restriction that we will impose on our walk is that that we will impose on our walk is that that we will impose on our walk is that we want take the same edge twice now if we want take the same edge twice now if
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,4:28,5:13,we want take the same edge twice now if we do this what happens then we can we do this what happens then we can we do this what happens then we can write the following statement if we walk at every vertex of course theres a at every vertex of course theres a particular case that you have to be

211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,6:03,6:08,inbetween vertex and you have no edges inbetween vertex and you have no edges to move that means you have come there to move that means you have come there to move that means you have come there some number of times and you have left some number of times and you have left
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,6:08,6:19,some number of times and you have left that vertex one less time okay so that vertex one less time okay so that vertex one less time okay so formally we can say this as the as formally we can say this as the as formally we can say this as the as following if we are let us say standard

211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,7:51,8:01,being connected okay we can say that if being connected okay we can say that if there are other edges which are there are other edges which are there are other edges which are traversed which are left behind then traversed which are left behind then traversed which are left behind then there should be some connection to that
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,8:01,8:07,there should be some connection to that there should be some connection to that to the left out edges and what we can do to the left out edges and what we can do to the left out edges and what we can do is on the first point from where there
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,8:07,8:12,is on the first point from where there is on the first point from where there is an edge which is not accounted for so is an edge which is not accounted for so is an edge which is not accounted for so look at this part and look at the first
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,8:12,8:18,look at this part and look at the first look at this part and look at the first place first vertex which has an edge place first vertex which has an edge place first vertex which has an edge which is not used we could start there which is not used we could start there
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,8:18,8:26,which is not used we could start there and then continue and we must and then continue and we must and then continue and we must essentially come back somewhere here essentially come back somewhere here essentially come back somewhere here okay we will never be stranded the only okay we will never be stranded the only
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,8:26,8:32,okay we will never be stranded the only way we can be standard this if we had way we can be standard this if we had way we can be standard this if we had come back here okay so we can just come back here okay so we can just
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,8:32,8:41,come back here okay so we can just traverse along the particular path traverse along the particular path traverse along the particular path complete that cycle and then continue on complete that cycle and then continue on complete that cycle and then continue on the original cycle so this can be done
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,8:41,8:52,the original cycle so this can be done the original cycle so this can be done inductively and therefore that will inductively and therefore that will inductively and therefore that will guarantee that if the degree of every guarantee that if the degree of every guarantee that if the degree of every vertex is even then we will
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,8:52,9:01,vertex is even then we will vertex is even then we will automatically have an oiler in circuit automatically have an oiler in circuit automatically have an oiler in circuit the other part is simpler if we had some the other part is simpler if we had some the other part is simpler if we had some vertex of odd degree then there are no
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,9:01,9:05,vertex of odd degree then there are no vertex of odd degree then there are no euler in circuits this can be seen euler in circuits this can be seen euler in circuits this can be seen because if you look at the euler in because if you look at the euler in
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,9:05,9:14,because if you look at the euler in circuit the euler in circuit goes circuit the euler in circuit goes circuit the euler in circuit goes through every edge so if you look at any through every edge so if you look at any through every edge so if you look at any particular vertex and count the edges it
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,9:14,9:21,particular vertex and count the edges it particular vertex and count the edges it is enter the euler and circuit has is enter the euler and circuit has is enter the euler and circuit has entered every vertex and left every entered every vertex and left every entered every vertex and left every vertex okay the number of times it is
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,9:21,9:25,vertex okay the number of times it is vertex okay the number of times it is entered is exactly equal to the number entered is exactly equal to the number entered is exactly equal to the number of times it is left that particular of times it is left that particular
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,9:25,9:31,of times it is left that particular vertex so since these are equal and vertex so since these are equal and vertex so since these are equal and together they account for the total together they account for the total together they account for the total degree of any vertex
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,9:31,9:40,degree of any vertex degree of any vertex we automatically get that the vertices we automatically get that the vertices we automatically get that the vertices must have an even degree every vertex must have an even degree every vertex must have an even degree every vertex must be of even degree so that concludes
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,9:40,9:47,must be of even degree so that concludes must be of even degree so that concludes the proof of eulers theorem now the the proof of eulers theorem now the the proof of eulers theorem now the next thing that we will learn today next thing that we will learn today
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,9:47,10:01,next thing that we will learn today there is another kind of walk or power there is another kind of walk or power there is another kind of walk or power of path on graphs which are called as of path on graphs which are called as of path on graphs which are called as hamiltonian cycles so we will first
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,10:01,10:12,hamiltonian cycles so we will first hamiltonian cycles so we will first define what our hamiltonian cycle a define what our hamiltonian cycle a define what our hamiltonian cycle a hamiltonian cycle is a cycle in which hamiltonian cycle is a cycle in which hamiltonian cycle is a cycle in which every vertex of the graph is visited
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,10:12,10:22,every vertex of the graph is visited every vertex of the graph is visited exactly once its a cycle in g so we are exactly once its a cycle in g so we are exactly once its a cycle in g so we are talking about hamiltonian cycle in a
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,10:22,10:38,talking about hamiltonian cycle in a talking about hamiltonian cycle in a graph g so of course the natural question to ask so of course the natural question to ask us where it does and given a graph does us where it does and given a graph does us where it does and given a graph does it have a hamiltonian cycle or not so we
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,10:38,10:50,it have a hamiltonian cycle or not so we it have a hamiltonian cycle or not so we will see some examples say if you take will see some examples say if you take will see some examples say if you take the complete graph on n vertices this of
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,10:50,10:59,the complete graph on n vertices this of the complete graph on n vertices this of course has many hamiltonian cycles you course has many hamiltonian cycles you course has many hamiltonian cycles you can start at any vertex and go to any can start at any vertex and go to any
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,10:59,11:09,can start at any vertex and go to any other vertex in this particular graph so other vertex in this particular graph so other vertex in this particular graph so complete graph on n vertices this is complete graph on n vertices this is complete graph on n vertices this is here their value of n is so k has a
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,11:09,11:20,here their value of n is so k has a here their value of n is so k has a hamiltonian cycle if you look at say the hamiltonian cycle if you look at say the hamiltonian cycle if you look at say the cycle graph this is also a graph which
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,11:20,11:39,cycle graph this is also a graph which cycle graph this is also a graph which contains a hamiltonian cycle whereas if contains a hamiltonian cycle whereas if contains a hamiltonian cycle whereas if you take this particular graph this does not have this particular graph this does not have a hamiltonian cycle because the vertex
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,11:39,11:44,a hamiltonian cycle because the vertex a hamiltonian cycle because the vertex little filly number this is vertex one little filly number this is vertex one little filly number this is vertex one if you start at vertex one you can never if you start at vertex one you can never
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,11:44,11:49,if you start at vertex one you can never end up back at vertex one and if you end up back at vertex one and if you end up back at vertex one and if you started any other vertex the moment you started any other vertex the moment you
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,11:49,11:56,started any other vertex the moment you reach vertex one you are stranded there reach vertex one you are stranded there reach vertex one you are stranded there okay and therefore this is a graph which okay and therefore this is a graph which okay and therefore this is a graph which doesnt have a hamiltonian cycle so in
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,11:56,12:03,doesnt have a hamiltonian cycle so in doesnt have a hamiltonian cycle so in these examples it was easy to see these examples it was easy to see these examples it was easy to see whether it contained the hamiltonian whether it contained the hamiltonian whether it contained the hamiltonian cycle or not unlike the euler ians

211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,12:12,12:37,will see a particular example so we will will see a particular example so we will again look at our peterson graph so this again look at our peterson graph so this again look at our peterson graph so this is a graph on ten vertices so this is vertices and edges and
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,12:37,12:45,so this is vertices and edges and we want to know whether this graph we want to know whether this graph we want to know whether this graph contains a hamiltonian cycle you can contains a hamiltonian cycle you can contains a hamiltonian cycle you can look at the graph for stare at it for a
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,12:45,12:50,look at the graph for stare at it for a look at the graph for stare at it for a few minutes and figure out if it does few minutes and figure out if it does few minutes and figure out if it does contain a hamiltonian cycle if it
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,12:50,12:59,contain a hamiltonian cycle if it contain a hamiltonian cycle if it doesnt contain a hamiltonian cycle what doesnt contain a hamiltonian cycle what doesnt contain a hamiltonian cycle what we have to show is that no matter how we have to show is that no matter how we have to show is that no matter how you walk in this graph you can never
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,12:59,13:03,you walk in this graph you can never you walk in this graph you can never start at the vertex and reach back at start at the vertex and reach back at start at the vertex and reach back at the same vertex after visiting every the same vertex after visiting every
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,13:03,13:35,the same vertex after visiting every vertex exactly once so in fact thats vertex exactly once so in fact thats vertex exactly once so in fact thats what we will show that this graph what we will show that this graph what we will show that this graph doesnt have a hamiltonian cycle
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,13:35,13:49,it doesnt draught doesnt contain a it doesnt draught doesnt contain a hamiltonian cycle why is that the case i hamiltonian cycle why is that the case i hamiltonian cycle why is that the case i will prove this claim via a very crucial will prove this claim via a very crucial
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,13:49,14:03,will prove this claim via a very crucial observation about peterson graph so observation about peterson graph so observation about peterson graph so lets call this british graph as g so lets call this british graph as g so lets call this british graph as g so first claim is g doesnt have any four
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,14:03,14:11,first claim is g doesnt have any four first claim is g doesnt have any four cycle okay this is a crucial fact that cycle okay this is a crucial fact that cycle okay this is a crucial fact that were going to use okay now how do we were going to use okay now how do we
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,14:11,14:18,were going to use okay now how do we see that this is a graph without for see that this is a graph without for see that this is a graph without for cycling okay now if you look at this cycling okay now if you look at this cycling okay now if you look at this graph carefully you will see that there
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,14:18,14:24,graph carefully you will see that there graph carefully you will see that there are two cycles in this graph each of are two cycles in this graph each of are two cycles in this graph each of length there are many five cycles but length there are many five cycles but
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,14:24,14:34,length there are many five cycles but you can see that there these outer you can see that there these outer you can see that there these outer pentagon and the inner star which also pentagon and the inner star which also pentagon and the inner star which also can be drawn as a pentagon okay so if i
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,14:34,14:38,can be drawn as a pentagon okay so if i can be drawn as a pentagon okay so if i number this is one two the outer ones is number this is one two the outer ones is number this is one two the outer ones is one two three four five and the inner
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,14:38,14:47,one two three four five and the inner one two three four five and the inner ones is six seven eight nine ten so you ones is six seven eight nine ten so you ones is six seven eight nine ten so you can see that also forms a can see that also forms a
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,14:47,15:08,can see that also forms a cycle so is a pentagon or a cycle so is a pentagon or a cycle so is a pentagon or a cycle and also form a cycle and also form a cycle and also form a pentagon now these cycles mean if you pentagon now these cycles mean if you
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,15:08,15:12,pentagon now these cycles mean if you considers these cycles there are no considers these cycles there are no considers these cycles there are no other edges between them for example other edges between them for example other edges between them for example between and there is no direct edge
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,15:12,15:19,between and there is no direct edge between and there is no direct edge between and also there is no edge so between and also there is no edge so between and also there is no edge so these cycles are two disjoint cycles and these cycles are two disjoint cycles and
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,15:19,15:28,these cycles are two disjoint cycles and they dont have if you just restrict the they dont have if you just restrict the they dont have if you just restrict the graph to those vertices there are no graph to those vertices there are no graph to those vertices there are no smaller cycles in it ok so if i look at
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,15:28,15:34,smaller cycles in it ok so if i look at smaller cycles in it ok so if i look at the graph consisting of just vertices the graph consisting of just vertices the graph consisting of just vertices they dont have a full cycle and if they dont have a full cycle and if
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,15:34,15:43,they dont have a full cycle and if i restrict to the graph two vertices i restrict to the graph two vertices i restrict to the graph two vertices to they also do not have a four cycle to they also do not have a four cycle to they also do not have a four cycle in it and therefore we can say that if
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,15:43,15:49,in it and therefore we can say that if in it and therefore we can say that if at all there was a four cycle it should at all there was a four cycle it should at all there was a four cycle it should have edges which go from
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,15:49,16:00,have edges which go from have edges which go from cycle to cycle there should be an cycle to cycle there should be an cycle to cycle there should be an edge any cycle should have an edge edge any cycle should have an edge edge any cycle should have an edge which goes from the outer circle to the
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,16:00,16:05,which goes from the outer circle to the which goes from the outer circle to the inner circle and outer circle to inner inner circle and outer circle to inner inner circle and outer circle to inner circle the edges are im going to draw circle the edges are im going to draw
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,16:05,16:11,circle the edges are im going to draw that in red so so these red red edges at that in red so so these red red edges at that in red so so these red red edges at least one of these red edges must be least one of these red edges must be
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,16:11,16:20,least one of these red edges must be present if there is any for cycling okay present if there is any for cycling okay present if there is any for cycling okay if there is a four cycle then that four if there is a four cycle then that four
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,16:20,16:27,if there is a four cycle then that four cycle must contain one of these red cycle must contain one of these red cycle must contain one of these red edges without red edges it is impossible edges without red edges it is impossible edges without red edges it is impossible to have a four cycle water will shows
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,16:27,16:34,to have a four cycle water will shows to have a four cycle water will shows even with the red edges there is no even with the red edges there is no even with the red edges there is no chance of having a four cycle so let us chance of having a four cycle so let us
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,16:34,16:38,chance of having a four cycle so let us say that one of these red edges is there say that one of these red edges is there say that one of these red edges is there all the other edges you can see that all the other edges you can see that
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,16:38,16:43,all the other edges you can see that from the symmetry we can assume that all from the symmetry we can assume that all from the symmetry we can assume that all of them one are of the same kind so if of them one are of the same kind so if
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,16:43,16:47,of them one are of the same kind so if there is a four cycle involved in one of there is a four cycle involved in one of there is a four cycle involved in one of the red edges then certainly there are the red edges then certainly there are
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,16:47,16:55,the red edges then certainly there are four cycles involving any other red edge four cycles involving any other red edge four cycles involving any other red edge as well that is from the symmetry of as well that is from the symmetry of as well that is from the symmetry of this diagram okay so let us say five six
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,16:55,17:03,this diagram okay so let us say five six this diagram okay so let us say five six is an edge which is there on some four is an edge which is there on some four is an edge which is there on some four cycle five to six okay now five to six
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,17:03,17:07,cycle five to six okay now five to six cycle five to six okay now five to six from five if there is a four cycle there from five if there is a four cycle there from five if there is a four cycle there are only two possible edges phi and
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,17:07,17:14,are only two possible edges phi and are only two possible edges phi and phi and from symmetry again we can say phi and from symmetry again we can say phi and from symmetry again we can say that we can just look at five one okay that we can just look at five one okay
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,17:14,17:19,that we can just look at five one okay so if there was a four cycle three of so if there was a four cycle three of so if there was a four cycle three of its vertices are already in place five its vertices are already in place five
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,17:19,17:24,its vertices are already in place five six and one okay and if there is a four six and one okay and if there is a four six and one okay and if there is a four cycle six and one should both be cycle six and one should both be
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,17:24,17:33,cycle six and one should both be connected to a common vertex and you can connected to a common vertex and you can connected to a common vertex and you can see that there is no such vertex six and see that there is no such vertex six and see that there is no such vertex six and one there is no other vertex such that
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,17:33,17:38,one there is no other vertex such that one there is no other vertex such that that vertex is connected to both one and that vertex is connected to both one and that vertex is connected to both one and six and since there are no other so that six and since there are no other so that
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,17:38,17:44,six and since there are no other so that is you cant have a vertex x is that six is you cant have a vertex x is that six is you cant have a vertex x is that six x is an edge and one x is an edge so
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,17:44,17:51,x is an edge and one x is an edge so x is an edge and one x is an edge so that basically means that peterson graph that basically means that peterson graph that basically means that peterson graph doesnt have any four cycle okay so how doesnt have any four cycle okay so how
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,17:51,17:59,doesnt have any four cycle okay so how is this fact going to help us show that is this fact going to help us show that is this fact going to help us show that peterson graph doesnt have a peterson graph doesnt have a peterson graph doesnt have a hamiltonian cycle so at the moment we
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,17:59,18:08,hamiltonian cycle so at the moment we hamiltonian cycle so at the moment we have shown that the graph g have shown that the graph g have shown that the graph g peterson graph doesnt have a four cycle peterson graph doesnt have a four cycle peterson graph doesnt have a four cycle we need to show that g doesnt have any
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,18:08,18:15,we need to show that g doesnt have any we need to show that g doesnt have any hamiltonian cycle now suppose g did have hamiltonian cycle now suppose g did have hamiltonian cycle now suppose g did have a hamiltonian cycle we can say that all a hamiltonian cycle we can say that all
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,18:15,18:23,a hamiltonian cycle we can say that all the vertices could have been traversed the vertices could have been traversed the vertices could have been traversed in a systematic manner so let us say the in a systematic manner so let us say the in a systematic manner so let us say the ordering of the vertices is v to v to
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,18:23,18:44,ordering of the vertices is v to v to ordering of the vertices is v to v to v so there is some ordering of we can just so there is some ordering of we can just place these vertices so i dont know place these vertices so i dont know
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,18:44,18:50,place these vertices so i dont know whether v is the vertex or v is whether v is the vertex or v is whether v is the vertex or v is the vertex and so on but there is some the vertex and so on but there is some the vertex and so on but there is some order in some way in which you can
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,18:50,18:57,order in some way in which you can order in some way in which you can traverse all of them ok so let us assume traverse all of them ok so let us assume traverse all of them ok so let us assume that the starting vertex is v okay now
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,18:57,19:01,that the starting vertex is v okay now that the starting vertex is v okay now this accounts i mean if you look at this accounts i mean if you look at this accounts i mean if you look at these cycles that accounts for the these cycles that accounts for the
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,19:01,19:11,these cycles that accounts for the edges in the graph ok now we can think edges in the graph ok now we can think edges in the graph ok now we can think about what are the other edges present about what are the other edges present about what are the other edges present just look at the hamiltonian cycle if
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,19:11,19:20,just look at the hamiltonian cycle if just look at the hamiltonian cycle if there was one and let us just draw it there was one and let us just draw it there was one and let us just draw it and we will get a cycle consisting of and we will get a cycle consisting of
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,19:20,19:29,and we will get a cycle consisting of edges and there are other remaining edges and there are other remaining edges and there are other remaining edges which we have to add to this to edges which we have to add to this to edges which we have to add to this to get our original graph where all can be
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,19:29,19:35,get our original graph where all can be get our original graph where all can be add that edge v is an arbitrary vertex add that edge v is an arbitrary vertex add that edge v is an arbitrary vertex if we had a hamiltonian cycle surely if we had a hamiltonian cycle surely
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,19:35,19:45,if we had a hamiltonian cycle surely there is one starting at any particular there is one starting at any particular there is one starting at any particular vertex good so because you look at the vertex good so because you look at the vertex good so because you look at the cycle start at look at any particular
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,19:45,19:49,cycle start at look at any particular cycle start at look at any particular vertex in the cycle start at that point vertex in the cycle start at that point vertex in the cycle start at that point and travers you will get another and travers you will get another
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,19:49,19:54,and travers you will get another hamiltonian cycle so if you have one hamiltonian cycle so if you have one hamiltonian cycle so if you have one hamiltonian cycle you can have the hamiltonian cycle you can have the hamiltonian cycle you can have the hamiltonian cycle start at any
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,19:54,20:09,hamiltonian cycle start at any hamiltonian cycle start at any particular vertex so we can assume that particular vertex so we can assume that particular vertex so we can assume that v is equal to vertex number okay now v is equal to vertex number okay now v is equal to vertex number okay now from v there are three edges two of
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,20:09,20:15,from v there are three edges two of from v there are three edges two of them have already been accounted for the them have already been accounted for the them have already been accounted for the third edge must go somewhere where all third edge must go somewhere where all
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,20:15,20:21,third edge must go somewhere where all can it go okay so here we have shown can it go okay so here we have shown can it go okay so here we have shown that g does not have a four cycle it is that g does not have a four cycle it is
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,20:21,20:33,that g does not have a four cycle it is apparent that g also doesnt have any apparent that g also doesnt have any apparent that g also doesnt have any triangles okay if you take any three of triangles okay if you take any three of triangles okay if you take any three of them they are not going to be they are
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,20:33,20:36,them they are not going to be they are them they are not going to be they are not going to form a triangle so g not going to form a triangle so g not going to form a triangle so g doesnt have any four cycle or three doesnt have any four cycle or three
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,20:36,20:46,doesnt have any four cycle or three cycle so v lets say v or v that cycle so v lets say v or v that cycle so v lets say v or v that would make a triangle in the graph the would make a triangle in the graph the
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,20:46,20:52,would make a triangle in the graph the graph does not have a triangle the same graph does not have a triangle the same graph does not have a triangle the same applies if you connect it to v because applies if you connect it to v because applies if you connect it to v because then you will have a
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,20:52,20:59,then you will have a then you will have a for cycling and the same applies if you for cycling and the same applies if you for cycling and the same applies if you connect it to v okay so now the only connect it to v okay so now the only
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,20:59,21:11,connect it to v okay so now the only three options are v could be connected three options are v could be connected three options are v could be connected to v v and v so v we can think to v v and v so v we can think
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,21:11,21:24,to v v and v so v we can think of v as the diametrically opposite of v as the diametrically opposite of v as the diametrically opposite vertex note that all of these vertices vertex note that all of these vertices vertex note that all of these vertices one to ten has one edge missing from
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,21:24,21:31,one to ten has one edge missing from one to ten has one edge missing from there okay and together there are five there okay and together there are five there okay and together there are five edges missing now can it be the case edges missing now can it be the case
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,21:31,21:39,edges missing now can it be the case that every vertex is joined to its that every vertex is joined to its that every vertex is joined to its diametrically opposite vertex along this diametrically opposite vertex along this diametrically opposite vertex along this particular path by diametrically particular path by diametrically
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,21:39,21:45,particular path by diametrically opposite what i mean is v and v are opposite what i mean is v and v are opposite what i mean is v and v are diametrically opposite v and v are diametrically opposite v and v are diametrically opposite v and v are diametrically opposite v and v are
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,21:45,22:15,diametrically opposite v and v are diametrically opposite v and v are diametrically opposite and so on okay so diametrically opposite and so on okay so diametrically opposite and so on okay so can every vertex here be joined to its diametrically opposite vertex if that diametrically opposite vertex if that was the case v is joined to v and b
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,22:15,22:23,was the case v is joined to v and b was the case v is joined to v and b is joined to meet ok if every vertex is joined to meet ok if every vertex is joined to meet ok if every vertex is joined to its diameter to the
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,22:23,22:31,is joined to its diameter to the is joined to its diameter to the opposite vertex and this is what would opposite vertex and this is what would opposite vertex and this is what would have happened but that automatically have happened but that automatically have happened but that automatically creates a four cycle b b b b okay
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,22:31,22:40,creates a four cycle b b b b okay creates a four cycle b b b b okay so this is not possible so there is at so this is not possible so there is at so this is not possible so there is at least one vertex which is not joined to
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,22:40,22:49,least one vertex which is not joined to least one vertex which is not joined to its diametrically opposite vertex okay its diametrically opposite vertex okay its diametrically opposite vertex okay so we may assume without loss of so we may assume without loss of so we may assume without loss of generality let that one vertex is v so
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,22:49,22:56,generality let that one vertex is v so generality let that one vertex is v so v we may assume that v is joined to v we may assume that v is joined to v we may assume that v is joined to one of b and b and these are symmetric
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,22:56,23:03,one of b and b and these are symmetric one of b and b and these are symmetric cases so we will just say that v is cases so we will just say that v is cases so we will just say that v is connected to b so we can assume without
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,23:03,23:12,connected to b so we can assume without connected to b so we can assume without loss of generality that v b loss of generality that v b loss of generality that v b five is an edge in the graph okay so our five is an edge in the graph okay so our
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,23:12,23:24,five is an edge in the graph okay so our starting point this we assume that there starting point this we assume that there starting point this we assume that there is a hamiltonian cycle and we somehow is a hamiltonian cycle and we somehow is a hamiltonian cycle and we somehow argued that hamiltonian cycle has
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,23:24,23:34,argued that hamiltonian cycle has argued that hamiltonian cycle has missing edges and if you look at the missing edges and if you look at the missing edges and if you look at the starting vertex is one its missing edge starting vertex is one its missing edge starting vertex is one its missing edge is towards goes to vertex b five okay so
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,23:34,23:38,is towards goes to vertex b five okay so is towards goes to vertex b five okay so this is part of the graph there are this is part of the graph there are this is part of the graph there are other edges also so if you look at
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,23:38,23:46,other edges also so if you look at other edges also so if you look at vertex six were all can six be vertex six were all can six be vertex six were all can six be connected to we argued that v and v connected to we argued that v and v
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,23:46,23:55,connected to we argued that v and v are not connected so there are other are not connected so there are other are not connected so there are other possibilities but we will see that if possibilities but we will see that if possibilities but we will see that if you assume i mean based on our claim
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,23:55,24:00,you assume i mean based on our claim you assume i mean based on our claim that g doesnt have a three cycle or that g doesnt have a three cycle or that g doesnt have a three cycle or four cycle we cannot connect six to any four cycle we cannot connect six to any
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,24:00,24:25,four cycle we cannot connect six to any other edges clearly and are other edges clearly and are other edges clearly and are ruled out because of three cycle v and ruled out because of three cycle v and ruled out because of three cycle v and b are ruled out because of four cycles
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,24:25,24:42,b are ruled out because of four cycles b are ruled out because of four cycles causes three cycles six nine six causes three cycles six nine six causes three cycles six nine six three causes four cycles so they cannot three causes four cycles so they cannot three causes four cycles so they cannot because v v v v forms a four
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,24:42,24:49,because v v v v forms a four because v v v v forms a four cycle so the only remaining vertices are cycle so the only remaining vertices are cycle so the only remaining vertices are so v v anyway are connected they so v v anyway are connected they
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,24:49,25:03,so v v anyway are connected they cannot be considered so amp ruled out cannot be considered so amp ruled out cannot be considered so amp ruled out amp are ruled out okay so the only amp are ruled out okay so the only amp are ruled out okay so the only remaining vertex is if you look at
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,25:03,25:11,remaining vertex is if you look at remaining vertex is if you look at six ten you again have a four cycle six ten you again have a four cycle six ten you again have a four cycle okay six ten one five forms a four cycle okay six ten one five forms a four cycle
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,25:11,25:22,okay six ten one five forms a four cycle so this also causes a four cycle and so this also causes a four cycle and so this also causes a four cycle and therefore therefore therefore we cannot have any edge out of six so we cannot have any edge out of six so
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,25:22,25:31,we cannot have any edge out of six so that contradicts our initial assumptions that contradicts our initial assumptions that contradicts our initial assumptions that there is a i mean if we have this that there is a i mean if we have this that there is a i mean if we have this particular edge we looked at the
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,25:31,25:38,particular edge we looked at the particular edge we looked at the peterson graph surely theres an edge peterson graph surely theres an edge peterson graph surely theres an edge between six and ten i mean six and some between six and ten i mean six and some between six and ten i mean six and some other vertex we argued that six cannot
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,25:38,25:45,other vertex we argued that six cannot other vertex we argued that six cannot have any outgoing edge other than b have any outgoing edge other than b have any outgoing edge other than b and b ok so by this argument we could and b ok so by this argument we could
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,25:45,25:54,and b ok so by this argument we could show that peterson graph is a graph show that peterson graph is a graph show that peterson graph is a graph without any hamiltonian cycle okay so without any hamiltonian cycle okay so without any hamiltonian cycle okay so this required careful examination of
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,25:54,26:00,this required careful examination of this required careful examination of many of the properties of peterson graph many of the properties of peterson graph many of the properties of peterson graph we could not have a we didnt have a we could not have a we didnt have a we could not have a we didnt have a general result like we had in the case
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,26:00,26:04,general result like we had in the case general result like we had in the case of euler in cyclic where and we told of euler in cyclic where and we told of euler in cyclic where and we told that we just have to look at the degree that we just have to look at the degree
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,26:04,26:11,that we just have to look at the degree of each vertex if each vertex is degree of each vertex if each vertex is degree of each vertex if each vertex is degree then automatically every connect if we then automatically every connect if we then automatically every connect if we connected such graphs is going to have
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,26:11,26:22,connected such graphs is going to have connected such graphs is going to have an euler in cycling so now we will move an euler in cycling so now we will move an euler in cycling so now we will move on to some different notions so we on to some different notions so we
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,26:22,26:28,on to some different notions so we learned about cycles we learned about learned about cycles we learned about learned about cycles we learned about two different types of cycles all over two different types of cycles all over two different types of cycles all over in cycle and hamiltonian cycle the next
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,26:28,26:35,in cycle and hamiltonian cycle the next in cycle and hamiltonian cycle the next special kind of graphs that we will look special kind of graphs that we will look special kind of graphs that we will look at is what are called as trees the trees at is what are called as trees the trees
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,26:35,26:47,at is what are called as trees the trees are graphs which is two crucial are graphs which is two crucial are graphs which is two crucial properties ok so lets call it by t so t properties ok so lets call it by t so t properties ok so lets call it by t so t is also this is a graph first
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,26:47,27:19,is also this is a graph first is also this is a graph first requirement is t should be connected the requirement is t should be connected the requirement is t should be connected the second requirement is that t should not any sightly so lets see some examples any sightly so lets see some examples if you look at this graph on six
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,27:19,27:27,if you look at this graph on six if you look at this graph on six vertices this is called as a star graph vertices this is called as a star graph vertices this is called as a star graph so this graph does not have any cycles so this graph does not have any cycles
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,27:27,27:36,so this graph does not have any cycles and it is a connected graph the line and it is a connected graph the line and it is a connected graph the line graph this is also an example of a tree graph this is also an example of a tree
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,27:36,27:44,graph this is also an example of a tree if you look at the real graph this is if you look at the real graph this is if you look at the real graph this is not a tree because there are many not a tree because there are many
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,27:44,27:58,not a tree because there are many different cycles in this graph you can different cycles in this graph you can different cycles in this graph you can have trees of different kind so this is have trees of different kind so this is have trees of different kind so this is an example of a rooted binary tree root
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,27:58,28:04,an example of a rooted binary tree root an example of a rooted binary tree root because b will usually i mean if when we because b will usually i mean if when we because b will usually i mean if when we draw it like this this signifies the
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,28:04,28:12,draw it like this this signifies the draw it like this this signifies the root and binary because every root and binary because every root and binary because every intermediary node has two children intermediary node has two children intermediary node has two children we will study about those things later
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,28:12,28:20,we will study about those things later we will study about those things later but you can see that this is a graph in but you can see that this is a graph in but you can see that this is a graph in which there are no cycles and that it is
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,28:20,28:25,which there are no cycles and that it is which there are no cycles and that it is a connected graph so these kind of a connected graph so these kind of a connected graph so these kind of graphs are called as trees will see some graphs are called as trees will see some
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,28:25,29:14,graphs are called as trees will see some crucial simple properties of trees there is a unique path from any vertex b there is a unique path from any vertex b to any other vertex you so choose two to any other vertex you so choose two to any other vertex you so choose two vertices between those two vertices
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,29:14,29:31,vertices between those two vertices vertices between those two vertices there is a unique path whenever the there is a unique path whenever the there is a unique path whenever the graph is a tree it will prove all these graph is a tree it will prove all these graph is a tree it will prove all these facts the second factors t has n minus
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,29:31,30:13,facts the second factors t has n minus facts the second factors t has n minus edges where n is the number of vertices results in precisely two disjoint trees results in precisely two disjoint trees okay so if you take a tree and remove okay so if you take a tree and remove
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,30:13,30:22,okay so if you take a tree and remove one edge from it you will get another one edge from it you will get another one edge from it you will get another graph which will have two connected graph which will have two connected graph which will have two connected components and both those connected
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,30:22,30:40,components and both those connected components and both those connected components will itself be trees okay we components will itself be trees okay we components will itself be trees okay we will quickly see a proof of these facts so you look at any particular vertex you so you look at any particular vertex you and any other vertex v we want to say
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,30:40,30:48,and any other vertex v we want to say and any other vertex v we want to say that there is precisely one part between that there is precisely one part between that there is precisely one part between them so we may assume the contraries them so we may assume the contraries
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,30:48,30:56,them so we may assume the contraries that is let us assume that there are that is let us assume that there are that is let us assume that there are more than one path between u and v so more than one path between u and v so more than one path between u and v so let us say this is some path and then
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,30:56,31:02,let us say this is some path and then let us say this is some path and then there is some other path okay so if you there is some other path okay so if you there is some other path okay so if you look at these two paths there is a first
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,31:02,31:09,look at these two paths there is a first look at these two paths there is a first place where these paths diverge these place where these paths diverge these place where these paths diverge these paths start at the same vertex and end paths start at the same vertex and end
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,31:09,31:19,paths start at the same vertex and end at the same vertex so clearly there is at the same vertex so clearly there is at the same vertex so clearly there is some place at which these paths diverge some place at which these paths diverge some place at which these paths diverge okay so let us say this is the point at
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,31:19,31:24,okay so let us say this is the point at okay so let us say this is the point at which they diverge and then of course which they diverge and then of course which they diverge and then of course they will come together at some place so they will come together at some place so
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,31:24,31:28,they will come together at some place so if you call this first point as i and if you call this first point as i and if you call this first point as i and then there is surely a first point after then there is surely a first point after
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,31:28,31:36,then there is surely a first point after i where they come together because i where they come together because i where they come together because surely they come together at v so they surely they come together at v so they surely they come together at v so they must come together at some point and the
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,31:36,31:44,must come together at some point and the must come together at some point and the first place where they come together first place where they come together first place where they come together lets call that as j so in between i and lets call that as j so in between i and
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,31:44,31:53,lets call that as j so in between i and j there are no common vertices the paths j there are no common vertices the paths j there are no common vertices the paths dont have any other common vertices in dont have any other common vertices in dont have any other common vertices in between int so these are all edges in
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,31:53,32:00,between int so these are all edges in between int so these are all edges in the graph now if you look at the graph now if you look at the graph now if you look at as inj and if you start walking from i as inj and if you start walking from i
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,32:00,32:06,as inj and if you start walking from i to j along the path one and then from j to j along the path one and then from j to j along the path one and then from j to i along the path to that is basically to i along the path to that is basically
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,32:06,32:11,to i along the path to that is basically a cycle in the original graph okay so if a cycle in the original graph okay so if a cycle in the original graph okay so if there are two parts then surely there is there are two parts then surely there is
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,32:11,32:46,there are two parts then surely there is a cycle in the original graph there are a cycle in the original graph there are a cycle in the original graph there are more than one path because by looking at these two parts we because by looking at these two parts we can say that there will surely be a
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,32:46,32:50,can say that there will surely be a can say that there will surely be a cycle in the original graph and the cycle in the original graph and the cycle in the original graph and the original graph by virtue of it being a original graph by virtue of it being a
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,32:50,33:01,original graph by virtue of it being a tree we know that it cannot contain any tree we know that it cannot contain any tree we know that it cannot contain any cycle okay so this cannot be the case cycle okay so this cannot be the case cycle okay so this cannot be the case that there are more than one path so
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,33:01,33:06,that there are more than one path so that there are more than one path so there is at most one path how do we say there is at most one path how do we say there is at most one path how do we say that there is there is at least one path
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,33:06,33:12,that there is there is at least one path that there is there is at least one path well because this is a connected graph well because this is a connected graph well because this is a connected graph between any two vertices you can go from between any two vertices you can go from
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,33:12,33:22,between any two vertices you can go from one vertex to another vertex okay so one vertex to another vertex okay so one vertex to another vertex okay so that proves statement one that there is that proves statement one that there is that proves statement one that there is a unique path we will now prove
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,33:22,33:32,a unique path we will now prove a unique path we will now prove statement three the removal of any edge statement three the removal of any edge statement three the removal of any edge results in two disjoint trees how do we results in two disjoint trees how do we
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,33:32,33:43,results in two disjoint trees how do we show this well lets look at one show this well lets look at one show this well lets look at one particular edge u comma v so theres a particular edge u comma v so theres a particular edge u comma v so theres a direct edge between u and b suppose we
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,33:43,33:50,direct edge between u and b suppose we direct edge between u and b suppose we remove this okay now look at all the remove this okay now look at all the remove this okay now look at all the vertices which are connected to you and vertices which are connected to you and
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,33:50,34:01,vertices which are connected to you and all the vertices which are connected to all the vertices which are connected to all the vertices which are connected to b now after removal of this edge there b now after removal of this edge there b now after removal of this edge there cannot be any third kind of vertex which
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,34:01,34:06,cannot be any third kind of vertex which cannot be any third kind of vertex which is neither connected to you nor is neither connected to you nor is neither connected to you nor connected to v because if there was one connected to v because if there was one
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,34:06,34:16,connected to v because if there was one such vertex then it is not connected to such vertex then it is not connected to such vertex then it is not connected to either you or v in the original graph either you or v in the original graph either you or v in the original graph and therefore we can argue that every
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,34:16,34:25,and therefore we can argue that every and therefore we can argue that every vertex in the original graph either vertex in the original graph either vertex in the original graph either belongs to this set su or sv now if you belongs to this set su or sv now if you
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,34:25,34:31,belongs to this set su or sv now if you remove u v su and s we are not going to remove u v su and s we are not going to remove u v su and s we are not going to be connected why because if they were
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,34:31,34:41,be connected why because if they were be connected why because if they were connected then it would mean that from connected then it would mean that from connected then it would mean that from you to be there is more than one path you to be there is more than one path
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,34:41,34:47,you to be there is more than one path okay because you to be there is a direct okay because you to be there is a direct okay because you to be there is a direct path and if su and s we were connected path and if su and s we were connected
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,34:47,34:58,path and if su and s we were connected by some other thing clearly by virtue of by some other thing clearly by virtue of by some other thing clearly by virtue of any vertex being in su there is a any vertex being in su there is a any vertex being in su there is a to to you and here theres a path to v
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,34:58,35:04,to to you and here theres a path to v to to you and here theres a path to v so you can go from mu to this particular so you can go from mu to this particular so you can go from mu to this particular vertex u prime and from u prime you can
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,35:04,35:09,vertex u prime and from u prime you can vertex u prime and from u prime you can go to v prime and v prime we can go back go to v prime and v prime we can go back go to v prime and v prime we can go back to v so thats an alternate path but by
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,35:09,35:17,to v so thats an alternate path but by to v so thats an alternate path but by our first fact we know that there is ak our first fact we know that there is ak our first fact we know that there is ak mode there is exactly one path so we can
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,35:17,35:25,mode there is exactly one path so we can mode there is exactly one path so we can argue that su and s we are disconnected argue that su and s we are disconnected argue that su and s we are disconnected components and by virtue of this being components and by virtue of this being
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,35:25,35:32,components and by virtue of this being connected to and all this by definition connected to and all this by definition connected to and all this by definition is all those things which are connected is all those things which are connected is all those things which are connected to you so that is a connected part and
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,35:32,35:36,to you so that is a connected part and to you so that is a connected part and of course there is no cycle in su if the of course there is no cycle in su if the of course there is no cycle in su if the were cycle in su then there is a cycle
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,35:36,35:41,were cycle in su then there is a cycle were cycle in su then there is a cycle in the original graph so this is a cycle in the original graph so this is a cycle in the original graph so this is a cycle free connected part and therefore that
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,35:41,35:46,free connected part and therefore that free connected part and therefore that set and this is also another so we set and this is also another so we set and this is also another so we know that the removal of any edge know that the removal of any edge
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,35:46,35:58,know that the removal of any edge results in exactly two disjoint trees results in exactly two disjoint trees results in exactly two disjoint trees and now we can prove the third fact that and now we can prove the third fact that and now we can prove the third fact that the that any tree has at most n minus
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,35:58,36:05,the that any tree has at most n minus the that any tree has at most n minus edges ok so if you take any tree with edges ok so if you take any tree with edges ok so if you take any tree with one vertex clearly there are no edges in
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,36:05,36:10,one vertex clearly there are no edges in one vertex clearly there are no edges in it so the base case would be that we are it so the base case would be that we are it so the base case would be that we are going to prove the statement by
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,36:10,36:21,going to prove the statement by going to prove the statement by induction and the induction hypothesis induction and the induction hypothesis induction and the induction hypothesis would be true for a graph with one would be true for a graph with one would be true for a graph with one vertex now you take any other tree
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,36:21,36:28,vertex now you take any other tree vertex now you take any other tree suppose it is more than one vertex and suppose it is more than one vertex and suppose it is more than one vertex and surely it should have an edge remove surely it should have an edge remove
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,36:28,36:42,surely it should have an edge remove that particular edge so take any t ok that particular edge so take any t ok that particular edge so take any t ok and if the number of vertex is greater and if the number of vertex is greater and if the number of vertex is greater than then surely there is at least one
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,36:42,36:52,than then surely there is at least one than then surely there is at least one edge so and remove any any of those edge edge so and remove any any of those edge edge so and remove any any of those edge and then we would get two components
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,36:52,37:00,and then we would get two components and then we would get two components lets say su and sv su is a tree and lets say su and sv su is a tree and lets say su and sv su is a tree and therefore the number of edges by
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,37:00,37:13,therefore the number of edges by therefore the number of edges by induction su has sizes you are then im when we su has sizes you are then im when we write size su that means the number of write size su that means the number of write size su that means the number of vertices in that particular component
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,37:13,37:26,vertices in that particular component vertices in that particular component minus one edges and sv has size sv minus minus one edges and sv has size sv minus minus one edges and sv has size sv minus one edges so together the total number one edges so together the total number
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,37:26,37:41,one edges so together the total number of edges that will be su minus sv of edges that will be su minus sv of edges that will be su minus sv minus plus for the edge uv that we minus plus for the edge uv that we minus plus for the edge uv that we had removed so that would be in size of
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,37:41,37:49,had removed so that would be in size of had removed so that would be in size of su plus size of sp that will be n minus su plus size of sp that will be n minus su plus size of sp that will be n minus plus which is equal to n minus
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,37:49,38:04,okay so any tree will have exactly n okay so any tree will have exactly n minus edges we will just define minus edges we will just define minus edges we will just define something for later so theres a notion something for later so theres a notion something for later so theres a notion of forest a forest is just a collection
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,38:04,38:15,of forest a forest is just a collection of forest a forest is just a collection of trees which are disjoint ok so if the of trees which are disjoint ok so if the of trees which are disjoint ok so if the collection had k disjoint trees and the
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,38:15,38:21,collection had k disjoint trees and the collection had k disjoint trees and the total number of vertices was n then we total number of vertices was n then we total number of vertices was n then we will have n minus k edges in it okay will have n minus k edges in it okay
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,38:21,38:27,will have n minus k edges in it okay which can be proven by the by fact by which can be proven by the by fact by which can be proven by the by fact by using fact to repeatedly okay we have using fact to repeatedly okay we have
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,38:27,38:38,using fact to repeatedly okay we have just one connected component the number just one connected component the number just one connected component the number of edges was n minus well its not off of edges was n minus well its not off of edges was n minus well its not off with the next topic which is known as
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,38:38,38:44,with the next topic which is known as with the next topic which is known as coloring so we will define what are coloring so we will define what are coloring so we will define what are called colorings so we have a graph and called colorings so we have a graph and
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,38:44,38:51,called colorings so we have a graph and then we want to color the vertices and then we want to color the vertices and then we want to color the vertices and what is a valid coloring thats what we what is a valid coloring thats what we what is a valid coloring thats what we will first define and then we will look
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,38:51,38:56,will first define and then we will look will first define and then we will look at a simple algorithm to color graphs ok at a simple algorithm to color graphs ok at a simple algorithm to color graphs ok so let us formally define what is a so let us formally define what is a
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,38:56,39:10,so let us formally define what is a coloring a coloring this is basically a coloring a coloring this is basically a coloring a coloring this is basically a function from vertex in this vertex set function from vertex in this vertex set function from vertex in this vertex set to natural numbers
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,39:10,39:26,and this funky function so any function and this funky function so any function from the vertex set to natural numbers from the vertex set to natural numbers from the vertex set to natural numbers is called as a coloring if it satisfies is called as a coloring if it satisfies
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,39:26,39:43,is called as a coloring if it satisfies certain requirements okay the certain requirements okay the certain requirements okay the requirement is c x should not be equal requirement is c x should not be equal requirement is c x should not be equal to c y if x comma y is an edge okay
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,39:43,39:46,to c y if x comma y is an edge okay to c y if x comma y is an edge okay although we are writing it as an ordered although we are writing it as an ordered although we are writing it as an ordered pair x y since we are looking at
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,39:46,39:53,pair x y since we are looking at pair x y since we are looking at undirected graphs they essentially mean undirected graphs they essentially mean undirected graphs they essentially mean the set x comma y okay so each vertex is the set x comma y okay so each vertex is
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,39:53,40:00,the set x comma y okay so each vertex is being assigned a number and vertices being assigned a number and vertices being assigned a number and vertices which share an edge between them they which share an edge between them they which share an edge between them they should be assigned different numbers so
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,40:00,40:11,should be assigned different numbers so should be assigned different numbers so lets look at our peterson graph if we lets look at our peterson graph if we lets look at our peterson graph if we give let us say red color to this give let us say red color to this
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,40:11,40:22,give let us say red color to this particular vertex then vertices and particular vertex then vertices and particular vertex then vertices and cannot be given red color they should cannot be given red color they should cannot be given red color they should be given a different color okay so these
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,40:22,40:27,be given a different color okay so these be given a different color okay so these colors you could assign them as numbers colors you could assign them as numbers colors you could assign them as numbers so this should be a different color it so this should be a different color it
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,40:27,40:43,so this should be a different color it can be the same color theres no problem can be the same color theres no problem can be the same color theres no problem because theres no edge between and ok so we can color this i mean these ok so we can color this i mean these vertices can be colored in this
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,40:43,40:55,vertices can be colored in this vertices can be colored in this particular manner and then can be particular manner and then can be particular manner and then can be given red color itself can again be given red color itself can again be given red color itself can again be given direct color but cannot be given
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,40:55,41:01,given direct color but cannot be given given direct color but cannot be given red color because is an edge and it red color because is an edge and it red color because is an edge and it cannot be given yellow color so it cannot be given yellow color so it
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,41:01,41:13,cannot be given yellow color so it should be given some other color blue should be given some other color blue should be given some other color blue color lets say and now if you look at color lets say and now if you look at color lets say and now if you look at vertex that also can be given blue
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,41:13,41:32,vertex that also can be given blue vertex that also can be given blue color because is not i mean the vertex because is not i mean the vertex cannot be given either red or yellow if cannot be given either red or yellow if cannot be given either red or yellow if you now look at vertex that can be
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,41:32,41:45,you now look at vertex that can be you now look at vertex that can be given red color and vertex can be given red color and vertex can be given red color and vertex can be given blue color ok vertex cannot be given blue color ok vertex cannot be
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,41:45,41:54,given blue color ok vertex cannot be given red or yellow because it is given red or yellow because it is given red or yellow because it is neighbors which is colored with the same neighbors which is colored with the same neighbors which is colored with the same color so here we can see that peterson
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,41:54,42:01,color so here we can see that peterson color so here we can see that peterson graph can be colored using three colors graph can be colored using three colors graph can be colored using three colors if you say red is one blue is and if you say red is one blue is and

211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,43:59,44:11,maximum degree has degree k then chi g or the chromatic number is less than or or the chromatic number is less than or or the chromatic number is less than or equal to k plus thats the first equal to k plus thats the first equal to k plus thats the first statement the second statement says if g
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,44:11,44:29,statement the second statement says if g statement the second statement says if g is connected and not regular then kaiji is connected and not regular then kaiji is connected and not regular then kaiji is less than or equal to k okay not is less than or equal to k okay not
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,44:29,44:37,is less than or equal to k okay not regular means so we will first define regular means so we will first define regular means so we will first define what are regular graphs so a graph is what are regular graphs so a graph is what are regular graphs so a graph is called regular if every vertex has the
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,44:37,44:45,called regular if every vertex has the called regular if every vertex has the same degree if you look at our peterson same degree if you look at our peterson same degree if you look at our peterson graph look at every vertex its degree is graph look at every vertex its degree is
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,44:45,44:53,graph look at every vertex its degree is exactly so this is an example of a exactly so this is an example of a exactly so this is an example of a three regular graph so if it is not three regular graph so if it is not three regular graph so if it is not regular then it will require less than
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,44:53,45:08,regular then it will require less than regular then it will require less than or equal to k if you look at this cycle or equal to k if you look at this cycle or equal to k if you look at this cycle graph every vertex has degree exactly two and
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,45:08,45:16,every vertex has degree exactly two and since the degree of every vertex is since the degree of every vertex is since the degree of every vertex is exactly two kaiji is less than or equal exactly two kaiji is less than or equal exactly two kaiji is less than or equal to three thats what the first statement
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,45:16,45:21,to three thats what the first statement to three thats what the first statement says but this is an example of a graph says but this is an example of a graph says but this is an example of a graph which is regular okay if you had taken which is regular okay if you had taken
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,45:21,45:26,which is regular okay if you had taken some other graph where the degree is at some other graph where the degree is at some other graph where the degree is at most two but it is not a regular graph most two but it is not a regular graph
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,45:26,45:38,most two but it is not a regular graph then you can argue that you dont then you can argue that you dont then you can argue that you dont require more than two colors okay so the require more than two colors okay so the require more than two colors okay so the proof of this theorem will be by an
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,45:38,45:54,proof of this theorem will be by an proof of this theorem will be by an algorithm so we will show that the algorithm so we will show that the algorithm so we will show that the greedy coloring algorithm will correctly greedy coloring algorithm will correctly greedy coloring algorithm will correctly color the graph without using more color

211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,46:50,46:58,coloring property okay so look at the coloring property okay so look at the vertex i and look at its neighbors so vertex i and look at its neighbors so vertex i and look at its neighbors so they would have got some color okay and they would have got some color okay and
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,46:58,47:29,they would have got some color okay and you can choose for i the color which is you can choose for i the color which is you can choose for i the color which is least amongst the acceptable colors okay so acceptable colors would mean any okay so acceptable colors would mean any number which is not a color of its

211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,48:25,48:32,number can surely be chosen as a color for i now we are using only colors from for i now we are using only colors from for i now we are using only colors from to d plus and that using these to d plus and that using these to d plus and that using these colors you can color the entire graph
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,48:32,48:40,colors you can color the entire graph colors you can color the entire graph and therefore the greedy coloring and therefore the greedy coloring and therefore the greedy coloring algorithm finds an acceptable coloring algorithm finds an acceptable coloring algorithm finds an acceptable coloring where you dont use any color greater
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,48:40,48:46,where you dont use any color greater where you dont use any color greater than d plus ok the second part of the than d plus ok the second part of the than d plus ok the second part of the theorem states that if you have a theorem states that if you have a
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,48:46,48:59,theorem states that if you have a connected graph which is not regular connected graph which is not regular connected graph which is not regular then you can color it with less than or then you can color it with less than or then you can color it with less than or equal to k colors so the max degree is k
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,48:59,49:08,equal to k colors so the max degree is k equal to k colors so the max degree is k and if the graph was not regular then k and if the graph was not regular then k and if the graph was not regular then k colors suffice clearly if the graph was
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,49:08,49:16,colors suffice clearly if the graph was colors suffice clearly if the graph was regular then we cannot guarantee that it regular then we cannot guarantee that it regular then we cannot guarantee that it will be colorable in k using k colors ok will be colorable in k using k colors ok
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,49:16,49:24,will be colorable in k using k colors ok for example if you take the pentagon for example if you take the pentagon for example if you take the pentagon which is a two regular graph we can see which is a two regular graph we can see which is a two regular graph we can see that we require at least three colors
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,49:24,49:31,that we require at least three colors that we require at least three colors but if you look at let us say this but if you look at let us say this but if you look at let us say this square this is the two regular graph and square this is the two regular graph and
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,49:31,49:38,square this is the two regular graph and it can be colored with two colors it can be colored with two colors it can be colored with two colors so the second condition just states that so the second condition just states that so the second condition just states that if you are guaranteed that it is not
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,49:38,49:45,if you are guaranteed that it is not if you are guaranteed that it is not regular then you dont need more than regular then you dont need more than regular then you dont need more than the max degree number of colors so lets the max degree number of colors so lets

211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,50:03,50:13,this by first stating what does be n ok this by first stating what does be n ok so what we know is that max degree is so what we know is that max degree is so what we know is that max degree is equal to k and this is not a curricular
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,50:13,50:18,equal to k and this is not a curricular equal to k and this is not a curricular graph this is not a regular graph if graph this is not a regular graph if graph this is not a regular graph if its not a regular graph then it means
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,50:18,50:23,its not a regular graph then it means its not a regular graph then it means that there is at least one vertex whose that there is at least one vertex whose that there is at least one vertex whose degree is less than k so we will choose degree is less than k so we will choose
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,50:23,50:34,degree is less than k so we will choose that vertex as bn so vn is the vertex of that vertex as bn so vn is the vertex of that vertex as bn so vn is the vertex of degree less than so the reza vertex degree less than so the reza vertex
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,50:34,50:42,degree less than so the reza vertex whose degree is strictly less than k and whose degree is strictly less than k and whose degree is strictly less than k and well take that vertex as vn so if you well take that vertex as vn so if you well take that vertex as vn so if you take vn its going to have lot of
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,50:42,50:47,take vn its going to have lot of take vn its going to have lot of neighbors in the graph so suppose this neighbors in the graph so suppose this neighbors in the graph so suppose this is your graph g and v n is this is your graph g and v n is this
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,50:47,50:54,is your graph g and v n is this particular vertex its connected to some particular vertex its connected to some particular vertex its connected to some other vertices okay there can be at most other vertices okay there can be at most other vertices okay there can be at most k minus one of them okay we first write
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,50:54,51:05,k minus one of them okay we first write k minus one of them okay we first write all of them okay in any order so vn all of them okay in any order so vn all of them okay in any order so vn minus vn minus up to be n minus r so
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,51:05,51:14,minus vn minus up to be n minus r so minus vn minus up to be n minus r so only requirement this r plus will be only requirement this r plus will be only requirement this r plus will be less than k ok and then we will take vn
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,51:14,51:21,less than k ok and then we will take vn less than k ok and then we will take vn and look at neighbors of vn so write and look at neighbors of vn so write and look at neighbors of vn so write down the neighbors of vn minus so
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,51:21,51:34,down the neighbors of vn minus so down the neighbors of vn minus so these are neighbors of vn minus and these are neighbors of vn minus and these are neighbors of vn minus and then we can write down neighbors of v n then we can write down neighbors of v n
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,51:34,51:48,then we can write down neighbors of v n minus and so on okay sorry this is the first block is okay sorry this is the first block is neighbors of v n and the second block is neighbors of v n and the second block is neighbors of v n and the second block is neighbors of v n minus one and so on
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,51:48,51:53,neighbors of v n minus one and so on neighbors of v n minus one and so on so of course when you are writing so of course when you are writing so of course when you are writing neighbors of v n minus one if you have neighbors of v n minus one if you have
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,51:53,51:58,neighbors of v n minus one if you have included if there are some common included if there are some common included if there are some common neighbors at the end you dont include neighbors at the end you dont include neighbors at the end you dont include them so all the fresh neighbors of v and
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,51:58,52:02,them so all the fresh neighbors of v and them so all the fresh neighbors of v and n minus one neighbors which is not been n minus one neighbors which is not been n minus one neighbors which is not been included so far is included into this included so far is included into this

211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,52:33,52:41,you pick okay lets say vi is some you pick okay lets say vi is some particular vertex one of its neighbors particular vertex one of its neighbors particular vertex one of its neighbors is somewhere ahead okay there is at is somewhere ahead okay there is at is somewhere ahead okay there is at least one neighbor which is further
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,52:41,52:47,least one neighbor which is further least one neighbor which is further ahead ahead ahead except for lets say v n vn does not except for lets say v n vn does not except for lets say v n vn does not have any neighbor ahead of it all its
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,52:47,52:53,have any neighbor ahead of it all its have any neighbor ahead of it all its neighbors are happy and would have neighbors are happy and would have neighbors are happy and would have appeared previously so if you take v i appeared previously so if you take v i
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,52:53,53:02,appeared previously so if you take v i and look at all its neighbors since at and look at all its neighbors since at and look at all its neighbors since at least one of the neighbors is in in least one of the neighbors is in in least one of the neighbors is in in front the number of colors used by the
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,53:02,53:09,front the number of colors used by the front the number of colors used by the greedy at coloring algorithm to color greedy at coloring algorithm to color greedy at coloring algorithm to color the neighbors of v i would be at most k the neighbors of v i would be at most k
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,53:09,53:18,the neighbors of v i would be at most k minus one okay because we i degree of vi minus one okay because we i degree of vi minus one okay because we i degree of vi is going to be less than or equal to k is going to be less than or equal to k
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,53:18,53:28,is going to be less than or equal to k but amongst these since at least one but amongst these since at least one but amongst these since at least one neighbor is in front of vi it comes neighbor is in front of vi it comes neighbor is in front of vi it comes after vi we know that the colors so far
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,53:28,53:34,after vi we know that the colors so far after vi we know that the colors so far used will be strictly less than k so used will be strictly less than k so used will be strictly less than k so there is at least one color left amongst
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,53:34,53:38,there is at least one color left amongst there is at least one color left amongst colors one to k and that color can be colors one to k and that color can be colors one to k and that color can be used for vi of course this argument
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,53:38,53:42,used for vi of course this argument used for vi of course this argument doesnt work for vn but v and we are doesnt work for vn but v and we are doesnt work for vn but v and we are anyway guaranteed that its degree is anyway guaranteed that its degree is
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,53:42,53:49,anyway guaranteed that its degree is less than k because thats how we chose less than k because thats how we chose less than k because thats how we chose bn so even for vn we will have a color bn so even for vn we will have a color
211.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,53:49,54:02,bn so even for vn we will have a color left with when we are left with when we are left with when we are via the greedy coloring method so that via the greedy coloring method so that via the greedy coloring method so that concludes the proof

212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,1:19,1:51,colors are referred to as bipartite colors are referred to as bipartite graph so lets write down the definition so if you have any graph and it can be so if you have any graph and it can be colored using two colors these are colored using two colors these are
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,1:51,1:55,colored using two colors these are called as bipartite graphs and the called as bipartite graphs and the called as bipartite graphs and the reason why they are called bipartite reason why they are called bipartite reason why they are called bipartite graph is because its naturally splits graph is because its naturally splits
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,1:55,2:03,graph is because its naturally splits into two parts okay so lets say these into two parts okay so lets say these into two parts okay so lets say these are all the vertices getting one color are all the vertices getting one color are all the vertices getting one color so lets call it as color one and these
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,2:03,2:08,so lets call it as color one and these so lets call it as color one and these are all the vertices getting color two are all the vertices getting color two are all the vertices getting color two now if you look at the edges of the now if you look at the edges of the
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,2:08,2:14,now if you look at the edges of the graph every edge is of this kind one end graph every edge is of this kind one end graph every edge is of this kind one end is in this particular set lets call it is in this particular set lets call it
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,2:14,2:20,is in this particular set lets call it this is a and this is b and the other this is a and this is b and the other this is a and this is b and the other edge will be in b okay this is how every edge will be in b okay this is how every
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,2:20,2:25,edge will be in b okay this is how every bipartite graph would look like one edge bipartite graph would look like one edge bipartite graph would look like one edge in d in one part and the other edge in in d in one part and the other edge in
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,2:25,2:33,in d in one part and the other edge in the other part because if you had two the other part because if you had two the other part because if you had two vertices in the same part then of course vertices in the same part then of course
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,2:33,2:42,vertices in the same part then of course these were the colors given to the these were the colors given to the these were the colors given to the graphs and if you had an edge in which graphs and if you had an edge in which graphs and if you had an edge in which both vertices were on one side then that
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,2:42,2:49,both vertices were on one side then that both vertices were on one side then that would essentially mean that that edge is would essentially mean that that edge is would essentially mean that that edge is not properly colored its endpoints not properly colored its endpoints not properly colored its endpoints received the same color so thats not
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,2:49,2:58,received the same color so thats not received the same color so thats not allowed so bipartite graphs are allowed so bipartite graphs are allowed so bipartite graphs are essentially two colorable graphs now we essentially two colorable graphs now we essentially two colorable graphs now we will give an alternate characterization
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,2:58,3:08,will give an alternate characterization will give an alternate characterization to bipartite graphs we write it as a to bipartite graphs we write it as a to bipartite graphs we write it as a theorem and well prove it a graph is theorem and well prove it a graph is
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,3:08,3:33,theorem and well prove it a graph is bipartite if and only if it contains no cycles of odd lengths and you look at no cycles of odd lengths and you look at all the cycles in the graph if none of all the cycles in the graph if none of
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,3:33,3:42,all the cycles in the graph if none of those cycles are of odd lengths then it those cycles are of odd lengths then it those cycles are of odd lengths then it will invariably be a bipartite graph will invariably be a bipartite graph will invariably be a bipartite graph okay and if you take a bipartite graph
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,3:42,4:02,okay and if you take a bipartite graph okay and if you take a bipartite graph that cannot contain any cycles of odd that cannot contain any cycles of odd that cannot contain any cycles of odd lengths lengths lengths lets try and prove this theorem the one direction is easy suppose lets
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,4:02,4:25,the one direction is easy suppose lets just imagine that there is an odd cycle suppose this is one particular cycle in suppose this is one particular cycle in the graph cycle of odd having odd number the graph cycle of odd having odd number the graph cycle of odd having odd number of edges now suppose this graph was
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,4:25,4:32,of edges now suppose this graph was of edges now suppose this graph was colorable then all these vertices would colorable then all these vertices would colorable then all these vertices would have gotten some color so if you take have gotten some color so if you take have gotten some color so if you take this what is one of these vertex start
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,4:32,4:37,this what is one of these vertex start this what is one of these vertex start at any vertex if you give color one to at any vertex if you give color one to at any vertex if you give color one to this its neighbors must surely get a
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,4:37,4:44,this its neighbors must surely get a this its neighbors must surely get a different color so this must be of color different color so this must be of color different color so this must be of color too too too theres no other option and this what theres no other option and this what
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,4:44,4:51,theres no other option and this what the next vertex should be of color one the next vertex should be of color one the next vertex should be of color one and the next should be two and the next and the next should be two and the next and the next should be two and the next should again be one and that would cause
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,4:51,5:01,should again be one and that would cause should again be one and that would cause this particular edge to be colored in this particular edge to be colored in this particular edge to be colored in such a way that both its vertices have such a way that both its vertices have
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,5:01,5:07,such a way that both its vertices have the same color so thats not a valid the same color so thats not a valid the same color so thats not a valid coloring so this would happen in any odd coloring so this would happen in any odd coloring so this would happen in any odd length cycle if you have a cycle of odd
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,5:07,5:12,length cycle if you have a cycle of odd length cycle if you have a cycle of odd lengths you start at any vertex by the lengths you start at any vertex by the lengths you start at any vertex by the time you reach back to the vertex you
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,5:12,5:17,time you reach back to the vertex you time you reach back to the vertex you will see that as the colors have to will see that as the colors have to will see that as the colors have to alternate the last edge cannot be alternate the last edge cannot be
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,5:17,5:24,alternate the last edge cannot be colored properly okay so odd length colored properly okay so odd length colored properly okay so odd length cycles would imply that the graph cannot cycles would imply that the graph cannot cycles would imply that the graph cannot be colored using two colors and hence
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,5:24,5:36,be colored using two colors and hence be colored using two colors and hence the graph cannot be bipartite so we know the graph cannot be bipartite so we know the graph cannot be bipartite so we know that odd length cycle implies not that odd length cycle implies not
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,5:36,5:57,that odd length cycle implies not bipartite so the contrapositive of this statement so the contrapositive of this statement would mean bipartite implies no odd would mean bipartite implies no odd would mean bipartite implies no odd cycles okay now we need to show the cycles okay now we need to show the
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,5:57,6:05,cycles okay now we need to show the other direction that is lets take a other direction that is lets take a other direction that is lets take a graph which doesnt contain any odd graph which doesnt contain any odd graph which doesnt contain any odd cycle that will be bipartite okay so
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,6:05,6:10,cycle that will be bipartite okay so cycle that will be bipartite okay so lets look at any graph and we are going lets look at any graph and we are going lets look at any graph and we are going to color the edges in a particular order to color the edges in a particular order
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,6:10,6:22,to color the edges in a particular order okay so we take any particular vertex okay so we take any particular vertex okay so we take any particular vertex let us call this as v so we are now let us call this as v so we are now let us call this as v so we are now looking at a graph without any odd
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,6:22,6:26,looking at a graph without any odd looking at a graph without any odd cycles and we will show that it is cycles and we will show that it is cycles and we will show that it is bipartite okay so let us take any bipartite okay so let us take any
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,6:26,6:44,bipartite okay so let us take any particular vertex of such a graph so let particular vertex of such a graph so let particular vertex of such a graph so let g be a graph without odd cycles and g be a graph without odd cycles and g be a graph without odd cycles and lets choose a particular vertex v okay
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,6:44,6:51,lets choose a particular vertex v okay lets choose a particular vertex v okay we are going to construct an ordering we are going to construct an ordering we are going to construct an ordering and for this we will first look at all and for this we will first look at all
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,6:51,6:59,and for this we will first look at all the vertices of vertices which are the vertices of vertices which are the vertices of vertices which are adjacent to v okay that is what we will adjacent to v okay that is what we will adjacent to v okay that is what we will call as level one okay
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,6:59,7:09,call as level one okay call as level one okay so level one consists of all vertices so level one consists of all vertices so level one consists of all vertices which are neighbors of v one and then we which are neighbors of v one and then we which are neighbors of v one and then we will look at the neighbors of vertices
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,7:09,7:19,will look at the neighbors of vertices will look at the neighbors of vertices in level one okay that will be at level in level one okay that will be at level in level one okay that will be at level two okay look at all their neighbors two okay look at all their neighbors
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,7:19,7:29,two okay look at all their neighbors except of course the neighbor v one we except of course the neighbor v one we except of course the neighbor v one we look at all the other neighbors and that look at all the other neighbors and that look at all the other neighbors and that we will be putting in the next level and
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,7:29,7:34,we will be putting in the next level and we will be putting in the next level and we continue this so we will get we continue this so we will get we continue this so we will get something like a levelled arrangement of something like a levelled arrangement of
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,7:34,7:42,something like a levelled arrangement of the vertices this is the level that is the vertices this is the level that is the vertices this is the level that is vertex v and then there are level vertex v and then there are level vertex v and then there are level vertices its neighbors will give you the
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,7:42,7:51,vertices its neighbors will give you the vertices its neighbors will give you the level and so on level and so on level and so on so this will have some number of levels so this will have some number of levels so this will have some number of levels note that if you look at the original
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,7:51,7:58,note that if you look at the original note that if you look at the original graph and look at all its edges they graph and look at all its edges they graph and look at all its edges they will pass for will pass for will pass for level i to level i plus one or level i
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,7:58,8:06,level i to level i plus one or level i level i to level i plus one or level i to level i minus one they cannot jump to to level i minus one they cannot jump to to level i minus one they cannot jump to levels because if if there was some
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,8:06,8:10,levels because if if there was some levels because if if there was some vertex here and there was an lets say vertex here and there was an lets say vertex here and there was an lets say there was some vertex at level one and there was some vertex at level one and
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,8:10,8:19,there was some vertex at level one and it is connected to level three then it is connected to level three then it is connected to level three then automatically it would have been in automatically it would have been in automatically it would have been in level two as well because its a
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,8:19,8:23,level two as well because its a level two as well because its a neighbor so it would have to be in level neighbor so it would have to be in level neighbor so it would have to be in level two so there is no possibility of two so there is no possibility of
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,8:23,8:32,two so there is no possibility of jumping the levels okay so all the jumping the levels okay so all the jumping the levels okay so all the neighbors were essentially accounted for neighbors were essentially accounted for neighbors were essentially accounted for here of course the previous neighbors here of course the previous neighbors
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,8:32,8:38,here of course the previous neighbors whatever i mean for example if you take whatever i mean for example if you take whatever i mean for example if you take a node here some of its neighbors are a node here some of its neighbors are a node here some of its neighbors are going to be here and then some of the
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,8:38,8:45,going to be here and then some of the going to be here and then some of the neighbors are going to be in the layer neighbors are going to be in the layer neighbors are going to be in the layer above it what we have argued us nothing
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,8:45,8:57,above it what we have argued us nothing above it what we have argued us nothing can go from one layer to this this is can go from one layer to this this is can go from one layer to this this is forbidden okay now can there be edge
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,8:57,9:05,forbidden okay now can there be edge forbidden okay now can there be edge between two vertices in the same level between two vertices in the same level between two vertices in the same level is this possible we will argue that this is this possible we will argue that this
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,9:05,9:15,is this possible we will argue that this is also not possible because suppose is also not possible because suppose is also not possible because suppose there was one such edge it is within a there was one such edge it is within a there was one such edge it is within a level then these would have some
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,9:15,9:22,level then these would have some level then these would have some ancestor some common ancestor of course ancestor some common ancestor of course ancestor some common ancestor of course v is their common ancestor but there v is their common ancestor but there v is their common ancestor but there could be some common ancestor at a layer
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,9:22,9:29,could be some common ancestor at a layer could be some common ancestor at a layer closer to this particular level if you closer to this particular level if you closer to this particular level if you call this as level i there is some other call this as level i there is some other
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,9:29,9:35,call this as level i there is some other level which is closer to i then lets level which is closer to i then lets level which is closer to i then lets say v and there is a node there such say v and there is a node there such
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,9:35,9:41,say v and there is a node there such that thats a common ancestor of both u that thats a common ancestor of both u that thats a common ancestor of both u and we okay now if you look at the and we okay now if you look at the
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,9:41,9:49,and we okay now if you look at the common ancestor and the path to you common ancestor and the path to you common ancestor and the path to you those apart from that common ancestor to those apart from that common ancestor to those apart from that common ancestor to v and apart from the common ancestor to
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,9:49,9:58,v and apart from the common ancestor to v and apart from the common ancestor to you and both these paths will have you and both these paths will have you and both these paths will have length exactly the height difference length exactly the height difference length exactly the height difference between these two layers and they will
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,9:58,10:04,between these two layers and they will between these two layers and they will be equal and therefore if you look at so be equal and therefore if you look at so be equal and therefore if you look at so if this was a common ancestor theres a if this was a common ancestor theres a
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,10:04,10:11,if this was a common ancestor theres a path common ancestor and then theres a path common ancestor and then theres a path common ancestor and then theres a path to you theres a path to be path to you theres a path to be path to you theres a path to be and theres an edge between them
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,10:11,10:19,and theres an edge between them and theres an edge between them together this forms an odd cycle because together this forms an odd cycle because together this forms an odd cycle because this path length is x this path length this path length is x this path length this path length is x this path length is x and this is of length and
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,10:19,10:23,is x and this is of length and is x and this is of length and therefore x plus being an odd number therefore x plus being an odd number therefore x plus being an odd number you have a cycle of odd lengths but we you have a cycle of odd lengths but we
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,10:23,10:32,you have a cycle of odd lengths but we assume that g is a graph without odd assume that g is a graph without odd assume that g is a graph without odd cycles we wrote it differently but yeah cycles we wrote it differently but yeah cycles we wrote it differently but yeah so this is g is a graph without odd
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,10:32,10:38,so this is g is a graph without odd so this is g is a graph without odd cycles so if you take a graph without cycles so if you take a graph without cycles so if you take a graph without odd cycles then this is not possible ok
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,10:38,10:45,odd cycles then this is not possible ok odd cycles then this is not possible ok so all the edges will be between so all the edges will be between so all the edges will be between adjacent layers and within a layer there adjacent layers and within a layer there
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,10:45,10:55,adjacent layers and within a layer there are no edges now any graph without odd are no edges now any graph without odd are no edges now any graph without odd cycle we can construct this leveled cycle we can construct this leveled cycle we can construct this leveled arrangement and now if you look at the
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,10:55,11:02,arrangement and now if you look at the arrangement and now if you look at the odd layers and give it one color and the odd layers and give it one color and the odd layers and give it one color and the even layers and give it another color we
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,11:02,11:10,even layers and give it another color we even layers and give it another color we can essentially get a valid coloring can essentially get a valid coloring can essentially get a valid coloring using just two color ok because between using just two color ok because between using just two color ok because between two odd layers the distance is at least
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,11:10,11:17,two odd layers the distance is at least two odd layers the distance is at least two and therefore there is no edge two and therefore there is no edge two and therefore there is no edge between them same applies for between between them same applies for between between them same applies for between the even layers ok so that completes
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,11:17,11:22,the even layers ok so that completes the even layers ok so that completes proof that i mean if you take a graph proof that i mean if you take a graph proof that i mean if you take a graph without odd cycles they can be colored without odd cycles they can be colored
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,11:22,11:32,without odd cycles they can be colored with two colors it is a two colorable with two colors it is a two colorable with two colors it is a two colorable graph or a bipartite graph now we will graph or a bipartite graph now we will graph or a bipartite graph now we will see another concept called as minimal
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,11:32,11:51,see another concept called as minimal see another concept called as minimal spanning trees we learned about trees and trees were we learned about trees and trees were graphs such that there were no cycles in graphs such that there were no cycles in graphs such that there were no cycles in it and that they were connected now here
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,11:51,11:59,it and that they were connected now here it and that they were connected now here when we are talking about minimal when we are talking about minimal when we are talking about minimal spanning tree we have a specialized kind spanning tree we have a specialized kind spanning tree we have a specialized kind of graph in under consideration so what
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,11:59,12:09,of graph in under consideration so what of graph in under consideration so what we will look at is what are called as we will look at is what are called as we will look at is what are called as weighted graphs so weighted graph is weighted graphs so weighted graph is
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,12:09,12:23,weighted graphs so weighted graph is nothing but a graph with the edges nothing but a graph with the edges nothing but a graph with the edges having a certain weight so a weighted having a certain weight so a weighted having a certain weight so a weighted graph is a graph with weights on the
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,12:23,12:31,graph is a graph with weights on the graph is a graph with weights on the edges that means we have a function edges that means we have a function edges that means we have a function thats wt which goes from the edge set thats wt which goes from the edge set
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,12:31,12:43,thats wt which goes from the edge set to natural numbers okay so w t e would to natural numbers okay so w t e would to natural numbers okay so w t e would be the this will be called as the weight be the this will be called as the weight
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,12:43,13:10,be the this will be called as the weight of the edge for example heres a weighted graph with six heres a weighted graph with six vertices and the weights being as vertices and the weights being as vertices and the weights being as indicated by the numbers above the edges
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,13:10,13:22,so here if you look at the edge a b and so here if you look at the edge a b and the edge bc there they are having the the edge bc there they are having the the edge bc there they are having the same weight so what we will assume in
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,13:22,13:32,same weight so what we will assume in same weight so what we will assume in our study of minimal spanning trees is our study of minimal spanning trees is our study of minimal spanning trees is that the edge weights are distinct say that the edge weights are distinct say
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,13:32,13:45,that the edge weights are distinct say if e is not equal to e then weight of if e is not equal to e then weight of if e is not equal to e then weight of e is not equal to weight of e so so e is not equal to weight of e so so
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,13:45,13:54,e is not equal to weight of e so so we can think about our weighted graphs we can think about our weighted graphs we can think about our weighted graphs as graphs having unique edge weights as graphs having unique edge weights as graphs having unique edge weights each edge weight is a distinct number
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,13:54,14:00,each edge weight is a distinct number each edge weight is a distinct number and we will assume that it is a natural and we will assume that it is a natural and we will assume that it is a natural number now lets define what our minimal number now lets define what our minimal
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,14:00,14:24,number now lets define what our minimal spanning trees a spanning tree is a tree spanning trees a spanning tree is a tree spanning trees a spanning tree is a tree so t suspending youre off a graph g so t suspending youre off a graph g so t suspending youre off a graph g is a treaty which is a sub graph of g so
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,14:24,14:28,is a treaty which is a sub graph of g so is a treaty which is a sub graph of g so there are no isolated vertices there are there are no isolated vertices there are there are no isolated vertices there are no isolated components so if you take a
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,14:28,14:34,no isolated components so if you take a no isolated components so if you take a sub graph of g this means this subset of sub graph of g this means this subset of sub graph of g this means this subset of the edges such that they form a
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,14:34,14:43,the edges such that they form a the edges such that they form a connected graph and it doesnt have any connected graph and it doesnt have any connected graph and it doesnt have any cycle in other words you wanted tree cycle in other words you wanted tree cycle in other words you wanted tree such that every vertex is part of this
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,14:43,14:51,such that every vertex is part of this such that every vertex is part of this tree for example if i take the red tree for example if i take the red tree for example if i take the red colored edges that forms a spanning tree colored edges that forms a spanning tree
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,14:51,15:01,colored edges that forms a spanning tree you can see that there are many spanning you can see that there are many spanning you can see that there are many spanning trees for this particular graphs now the trees for this particular graphs now the trees for this particular graphs now the weight of a spanning tree is defined as
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,15:01,15:19,weight of a spanning tree is defined as weight of a spanning tree is defined as the sum of the weights of the edges so weight of a spanning tree is the sum so weight of a spanning tree is the sum over the edges in tea weight of edge for
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,15:19,15:24,over the edges in tea weight of edge for over the edges in tea weight of edge for example the red tree that has been example the red tree that has been example the red tree that has been described its weight this so if you call described its weight this so if you call
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,15:24,15:31,described its weight this so if you call the red tree by tea weight of t is equal the red tree by tea weight of t is equal the red tree by tea weight of t is equal to one plus three plus two plus five to one plus three plus two plus five
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,15:31,15:45,to one plus three plus two plus five plus six so that is and minimal plus six so that is and minimal plus six so that is and minimal spanning tree is a tree which has the spanning tree is a tree which has the spanning tree is a tree which has the smallest weight amongst all the spanning
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,15:45,15:53,smallest weight amongst all the spanning smallest weight amongst all the spanning trees so there could be multiple trees so there could be multiple trees so there could be multiple spanning trees and if we didnt assume spanning trees and if we didnt assume spanning trees and if we didnt assume that the edge weights are distinct
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,15:53,16:03,that the edge weights are distinct that the edge weights are distinct theres a possibility that the there theres a possibility that the there theres a possibility that the there could be multiple trees with same weight could be multiple trees with same weight could be multiple trees with same weight and so all of them will be valid minimal
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,16:03,16:10,and so all of them will be valid minimal and so all of them will be valid minimal spanning trees look at the smallest spanning trees look at the smallest spanning trees look at the smallest weighted tree spanning tree thats weighted tree spanning tree thats weighted tree spanning tree thats called as a minimal spanning tree for
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,16:10,16:32,called as a minimal spanning tree for called as a minimal spanning tree for example in this graph if you take example in this graph if you take example in this graph if you take another collection of edges so if you take these blue colored edges so if you take these blue colored edges their weight is going to be if you call
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,16:32,16:43,their weight is going to be if you call their weight is going to be if you call them as t weight of t is going to be them as t weight of t is going to be them as t weight of t is going to be plus plus plus plus thats going
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,16:43,16:51,plus plus plus plus thats going plus plus plus plus thats going to be so thats less than t but it is to be so thats less than t but it is to be so thats less than t but it is not clear why this should be the minimal
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,16:51,16:58,not clear why this should be the minimal not clear why this should be the minimal spanning tree of this particular graph spanning tree of this particular graph spanning tree of this particular graph now we will see certain properties which now we will see certain properties which now we will see certain properties which will help us compute the minimal
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,16:58,17:06,will help us compute the minimal will help us compute the minimal spanning tree of any graph so there are spanning tree of any graph so there are spanning tree of any graph so there are two crucial properties which will help two crucial properties which will help two crucial properties which will help us identify the minimal spanning tree
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,17:06,17:40,us identify the minimal spanning tree us identify the minimal spanning tree the first property is called as the cut the first property is called as the cut the first property is called as the cut property so cut property essentially states that so cut property essentially states that the least weighted cottage is part of
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,17:40,18:00,the least weighted cottage is part of the least weighted cottage is part of every minimal spanning tree so we need to understand what is a so we need to understand what is a cottage so a cut is defined as a cottage so a cut is defined as a
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,18:00,18:17,cottage so a cut is defined as a partition of the vertices so when we say partition of vertices we so when we say partition of vertices we need to get so we need we need to have a need to get so we need we need to have a
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,18:17,18:32,need to get so we need we need to have a partition of the vertices into two parts okay and two non empty parts so lets okay and two non empty parts so lets say this is your part a and this is part say this is your part a and this is part
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,18:32,18:44,say this is your part a and this is part b so a union b is your vertex collection b so a union b is your vertex collection b so a union b is your vertex collection of vertex vertex set and the edges so of vertex vertex set and the edges so
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,18:44,18:51,of vertex vertex set and the edges so now if you look at the edges of the now if you look at the edges of the now if you look at the edges of the graph there are three kinds of edges graph there are three kinds of edges graph there are three kinds of edges edges which lie completely inside a
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,18:51,18:59,edges which lie completely inside a edges which lie completely inside a edges with sly completely inside b and edges with sly completely inside b and edges with sly completely inside b and then there are edges which go from a to then there are edges which go from a to
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,18:59,19:10,then there are edges which go from a to b these are the only three kinds of b these are the only three kinds of b these are the only three kinds of edges and these edges which go from one edges and these edges which go from one edges and these edges which go from one part of the cut to the other part is
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,19:10,19:16,part of the cut to the other part is part of the cut to the other part is called as the cut ends okay so that called as the cut ends okay so that called as the cut ends okay so that essentially tells us what is the cut essentially tells us what is the cut
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,19:16,19:30,essentially tells us what is the cut property look at all these edges these property look at all these edges these property look at all these edges these cut edges for any possible cut all such cut edges for any possible cut all such cut edges for any possible cut all such edges would essentially be part of every
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,19:30,19:38,edges would essentially be part of every edges would essentially be part of every minimal spanning tree here we are minimal spanning tree here we are minimal spanning tree here we are assuming that the edge weights are assuming that the edge weights are assuming that the edge weights are distinct and therefore there will be a
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,19:38,19:48,distinct and therefore there will be a distinct and therefore there will be a unique least weighted cut edge we can unique least weighted cut edge we can unique least weighted cut edge we can always relax these conditions for always relax these conditions for always relax these conditions for example if there are multiple edges
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,19:48,19:58,example if there are multiple edges example if there are multiple edges carrying the same weight even then we carrying the same weight even then we carrying the same weight even then we can apply cut property for that what we can apply cut property for that what we can apply cut property for that what we need to guarantee is that for the cut
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,19:58,20:05,need to guarantee is that for the cut need to guarantee is that for the cut that we have chosen there is a least that we have chosen there is a least that we have chosen there is a least weighted cut it there is a there is one weighted cut it there is a there is one
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,20:05,20:12,weighted cut it there is a there is one cut it whose weight is strictly less cut it whose weight is strictly less cut it whose weight is strictly less than every other one and that cut edge than every other one and that cut edge than every other one and that cut edge should be present in everything else if
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,20:12,20:21,should be present in everything else if should be present in everything else if you had multiple cut edges minimum ones you had multiple cut edges minimum ones you had multiple cut edges minimum ones minimal ones all having the same weight minimal ones all having the same weight minimal ones all having the same weight then what we can do mean that at best is
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,20:21,20:33,then what we can do mean that at best is then what we can do mean that at best is that one of those that one of those that one of those would be part of every minimal spanning would be part of every minimal spanning would be part of every minimal spanning tree so let us look at some particular
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,20:33,20:51,tree so let us look at some particular tree so let us look at some particular uses of them above lemma so if you look uses of them above lemma so if you look uses of them above lemma so if you look at the cut where vertex a is on one side
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,20:51,20:59,so if vertex a is on one side and so if vertex a is on one side and everything else is on the other side everything else is on the other side everything else is on the other side okay and there are two edges which goes okay and there are two edges which goes
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,20:59,21:06,okay and there are two edges which goes from this side to the other side namely from this side to the other side namely from this side to the other side namely the edge having weight one and the edge the edge having weight one and the edge the edge having weight one and the edge having weight to the cut property says
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,21:06,21:15,having weight to the cut property says having weight to the cut property says that one must surely be present in all that one must surely be present in all that one must surely be present in all minimal spanning trees why is this so we minimal spanning trees why is this so we
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,21:15,21:22,minimal spanning trees why is this so we will see shortly similarly if we had will see shortly similarly if we had will see shortly similarly if we had taken a and b as a cut has one side of taken a and b as a cut has one side of
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,21:22,21:35,taken a and b as a cut has one side of the cut and rests everything on the the cut and rests everything on the the cut and rests everything on the other side or abd on one side and cef on other side or abd on one side and cef on
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,21:35,21:40,other side or abd on one side and cef on the other side and there are two cut the other side and there are two cut the other side and there are two cut edges namely the edge four and the edge edges namely the edge four and the edge
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,21:40,21:51,edges namely the edge four and the edge five sorry the edge having weighed four five sorry the edge having weighed four five sorry the edge having weighed four and they are shying away and we can and they are shying away and we can and they are shying away and we can say that the edge bc will surely be part
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,21:51,22:18,say that the edge bc will surely be part say that the edge bc will surely be part of every minimal spanning tree now lets see how we can prove cut now lets see how we can prove cut property now suppose the cut properties falls now suppose the cut properties falls what does it mean that means there is
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,22:18,22:29,what does it mean that means there is what does it mean that means there is some particular edge which is the least some particular edge which is the least some particular edge which is the least weighted cottage but is still not weighted cottage but is still not weighted cottage but is still not present in the minimal spanning tree so
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,22:29,22:46,present in the minimal spanning tree so present in the minimal spanning tree so suppose lets say the edge e is equal to suppose lets say the edge e is equal to suppose lets say the edge e is equal to u comma v is the minimum weighted cut u comma v is the minimum weighted cut
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,22:46,22:52,u comma v is the minimum weighted cut edge okay across lets say the cut we edge okay across lets say the cut we edge okay across lets say the cut we will call it as a comma b cut it means will call it as a comma b cut it means
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,22:52,22:58,will call it as a comma b cut it means one side is there and the other side is one side is there and the other side is one side is there and the other side is b and a let us say a contains u and b b and a let us say a contains u and b
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,22:58,23:09,b and a let us say a contains u and b contains we okay that is how thats how contains we okay that is how thats how contains we okay that is how thats how you v is a cut edge and suppose e does you v is a cut edge and suppose e does
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,23:09,23:22,you v is a cut edge and suppose e does not belong to mst so lets just draw the not belong to mst so lets just draw the not belong to mst so lets just draw the mst so some tree is there and then if mst so some tree is there and then if
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,23:22,23:33,mst so some tree is there and then if you add this edge into it what will you add this edge into it what will you add this edge into it what will happen is thats going to create a cycle happen is thats going to create a cycle happen is thats going to create a cycle okay because the spanning tree by virtue
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,23:33,23:39,okay because the spanning tree by virtue okay because the spanning tree by virtue of this being a spanning tree there is of this being a spanning tree there is of this being a spanning tree there is already a path between u and v okay already a path between u and v okay
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,23:39,23:58,already a path between u and v okay because every vertex was present and because every vertex was present and because every vertex was present and this is the tree now if you add the edge this is the tree now if you add the edge this is the tree now if you add the edge uv thats going to create a cycle
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,23:58,24:21,now can we somehow say that the minimal now can we somehow say that the minimal spanning tree that you currently have is spanning tree that you currently have is spanning tree that you currently have is not the optimal spanning tree so this diagram was our spanning tree t
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,24:21,24:28,so this diagram was our spanning tree t and we are assuming that uv is a minimum and we are assuming that uv is a minimum and we are assuming that uv is a minimum weighted cutted now minimum rated weighted cutted now minimum rated weighted cutted now minimum rated cartridge means it is across some
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,24:28,24:37,cartridge means it is across some cartridge means it is across some particular cutting a comma b and we want particular cutting a comma b and we want particular cutting a comma b and we want to identify those vertices so let us to identify those vertices so let us
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,24:37,25:07,to identify those vertices so let us first draw the diagram on top of this diagram given the layout on top of this diagram given the layout are three so three will you have some are three so three will you have some are three so three will you have some edges on the a side some edges on the b
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,25:07,25:13,edges on the a side some edges on the b edges on the a side some edges on the b side and surely because it is a tree side and surely because it is a tree side and surely because it is a tree there are going to be edges going from
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,25:13,25:28,there are going to be edges going from there are going to be edges going from one side to the other now what we are guaranteed by our now what we are guaranteed by our assumptions is that uv is not one of the assumptions is that uv is not one of the
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,25:28,25:36,assumptions is that uv is not one of the edges but if you add uv to this thats edges but if you add uv to this thats edges but if you add uv to this thats going to create a cycle okay so lets going to create a cycle okay so lets
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,25:36,25:43,going to create a cycle okay so lets just add the edge uv so suppose you is just add the edge uv so suppose you is just add the edge uv so suppose you is this and v is this we add uv to this this and v is this we add uv to this
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,25:43,25:49,this and v is this we add uv to this thats going to create a cycle and in thats going to create a cycle and in thats going to create a cycle and in this cycle by virtue of this being a this cycle by virtue of this being a
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,25:49,25:57,this cycle by virtue of this being a cycle the ravine if you just trace the cycle the ravine if you just trace the cycle the ravine if you just trace the edges there is a path from v to u ok u edges there is a path from v to u ok u
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,25:57,26:02,edges there is a path from v to u ok u to v is an edge that we had added and to v is an edge that we had added and to v is an edge that we had added and surely theres a path from v to u and
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,26:02,26:08,surely theres a path from v to u and surely theres a path from v to u and that path should surely cross the cut at that path should surely cross the cut at that path should surely cross the cut at some point okay that means there is an
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,26:08,26:14,some point okay that means there is an some point okay that means there is an edge which starts in b and ends up in a edge which starts in b and ends up in a edge which starts in b and ends up in a by virtue of that being a cut edge for
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,26:14,26:20,by virtue of that being a cut edge for by virtue of that being a cut edge for the cut a b its weight so lets call the cut a b its weight so lets call the cut a b its weight so lets call this as e prime weight of e prime is
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,26:20,26:27,this as e prime weight of e prime is this as e prime weight of e prime is going to be greater than weight of e so going to be greater than weight of e so going to be greater than weight of e so now lets imagine the tree which is
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,26:27,26:35,now lets imagine the tree which is now lets imagine the tree which is obtained by removing the edge e prime so obtained by removing the edge e prime so obtained by removing the edge e prime so this edge we are throwing out and we are this edge we are throwing out and we are
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,26:35,26:42,this edge we are throwing out and we are in place of that adding the uv edge now in place of that adding the uv edge now in place of that adding the uv edge now we will shame that the new object is we will shame that the new object is
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,26:42,26:46,we will shame that the new object is going to be a tree its going to be a going to be a tree its going to be a going to be a tree its going to be a tree because this doesnt contain any tree because this doesnt contain any
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,26:46,26:56,tree because this doesnt contain any cycle the only cycle that was there was cycle the only cycle that was there was cycle the only cycle that was there was the cycle that we got by adding uv that the cycle that we got by adding uv that the cycle that we got by adding uv that cycle has been destroyed by removing the
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,26:56,27:00,cycle has been destroyed by removing the cycle has been destroyed by removing the edge e prime so this is a cyclefree edge e prime so this is a cyclefree edge e prime so this is a cyclefree graph and every vertex which is graph and every vertex which is
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,27:00,27:07,graph and every vertex which is connected earlier still remains connected earlier still remains connected earlier still remains connected so this is a new tree and the connected so this is a new tree and the connected so this is a new tree and the way way way of this particular tree so let us say
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,27:07,27:18,of this particular tree so let us say of this particular tree so let us say the new tree is t prime rate of t prime the new tree is t prime rate of t prime the new tree is t prime rate of t prime is equal to weight of t plus weight of
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,27:18,27:27,is equal to weight of t plus weight of is equal to weight of t plus weight of uv minus weight of b prime but e primes uv minus weight of b prime but e primes uv minus weight of b prime but e primes weight is going to be greater than the
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,27:27,27:35,weight is going to be greater than the weight is going to be greater than the weight of uv or the edge e and therefore weight of uv or the edge e and therefore weight of uv or the edge e and therefore this quantity is a negative quantity so
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,27:35,27:38,this quantity is a negative quantity so this quantity is a negative quantity so weight of t plus a negative quantity weight of t plus a negative quantity weight of t plus a negative quantity will give you the weight of t prime and will give you the weight of t prime and
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,27:38,27:47,will give you the weight of t prime and this contradicts the assumption that tip this contradicts the assumption that tip this contradicts the assumption that tip was the tree having least weight so its was the tree having least weight so its was the tree having least weight so its not a minimal spanning this argument
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,27:47,27:52,not a minimal spanning this argument not a minimal spanning this argument tells us that t cannot be the minimal tells us that t cannot be the minimal tells us that t cannot be the minimal spanning tree because we have found one spanning tree because we have found one
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,27:52,28:03,spanning tree because we have found one particular tree whose weight is strictly particular tree whose weight is strictly particular tree whose weight is strictly less than that of t thats the proof of less than that of t thats the proof of less than that of t thats the proof of cut property so construct any possible

212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,28:45,28:55,so consider recycle in any graph any so consider recycle in any graph any weighted graph and look at the maximum weighted graph and look at the maximum weighted graph and look at the maximum weighted edge in that cycle make a guess weighted edge in that cycle make a guess
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,28:55,29:05,weighted edge in that cycle make a guess as to whether that edge will be present as to whether that edge will be present as to whether that edge will be present or absent in minimal spanning trees or absent in minimal spanning trees or absent in minimal spanning trees cycling property states that max
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,29:05,29:21,cycling property states that max cycling property states that max weighted edge will not be part of any weighted edge will not be part of any weighted edge will not be part of any minimal spanning tree okay so how do we minimal spanning tree okay so how do we
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,29:21,29:47,minimal spanning tree okay so how do we prove this lets take a graph d and prove this lets take a graph d and prove this lets take a graph d and suppose the sightly property is false before we go into the proof lets see a before we go into the proof lets see a couple of examples so in this particular
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,29:47,29:55,couple of examples so in this particular couple of examples so in this particular diagram in this graph g if we look at db diagram in this graph g if we look at db diagram in this graph g if we look at db thats the maximum weighted edge of the
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,29:55,30:09,thats the maximum weighted edge of the thats the maximum weighted edge of the cycle involving edges with weight amp cycle involving edges with weight amp cycle involving edges with weight amp so the edge marked in green cannot be so the edge marked in green cannot be so the edge marked in green cannot be present zetsu cannot be present because
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,30:09,30:16,present zetsu cannot be present because present zetsu cannot be present because its a maximum weight arranged the same its a maximum weight arranged the same its a maximum weight arranged the same applies to the edge ec because thats applies to the edge ec because thats applies to the edge ec because thats also the maximum weighted edge is the
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,30:16,30:26,also the maximum weighted edge is the also the maximum weighted edge is the cycle bce d and ef is also not part of a cycle bce d and ef is also not part of a cycle bce d and ef is also not part of a minimal spanning tree of part of any
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,30:26,30:39,minimal spanning tree of part of any minimal spanning tree of part of any minimal spanning tree because thats the minimal spanning tree because thats the minimal spanning tree because thats the maximum weighted edge of the cycle c f e ok so in this diagram in this graph if
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,30:39,30:47,ok so in this diagram in this graph if you look at the edges that has been you look at the edges that has been you look at the edges that has been excluded they are fit to be excluded excluded they are fit to be excluded excluded they are fit to be excluded none of those edges can be part of any
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,30:47,30:52,none of those edges can be part of any none of those edges can be part of any minimal spanning tree and therefore if minimal spanning tree and therefore if minimal spanning tree and therefore if you look at the remaining edges they you look at the remaining edges they
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,30:52,30:59,you look at the remaining edges they must be part of every minimal spanning must be part of every minimal spanning must be part of every minimal spanning tree okay reason being if you remove any tree okay reason being if you remove any tree okay reason being if you remove any one of them
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,30:59,31:09,one of them one of them there is no other edge that you can add there is no other edge that you can add there is no other edge that you can add to make this graph connected so this to make this graph connected so this to make this graph connected so this tree indicated by the blue lines are
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,31:09,31:22,tree indicated by the blue lines are tree indicated by the blue lines are going to be the unique minimal spanning going to be the unique minimal spanning going to be the unique minimal spanning tree now lets see bicycling properties tree now lets see bicycling properties tree now lets see bicycling properties true lets see a proof of cycle property
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,31:22,31:57,so suppose cycling property is false so suppose cycling property is false what does it mean that means there exists a cycle such that e is the there exists a cycle such that e is the maximum weight edge of that cycle and he maximum weight edge of that cycle and he
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,31:57,32:05,maximum weight edge of that cycle and he belongs to the minimal spanning tree belongs to the minimal spanning tree belongs to the minimal spanning tree lets call the minimal spanning tree s t lets call the minimal spanning tree s t lets call the minimal spanning tree s t so e belongs to t e is an edge of the
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,32:05,32:16,so e belongs to t e is an edge of the so e belongs to t e is an edge of the tree t ok this should give us a tree t ok this should give us a tree t ok this should give us a contradiction so lets look at our three
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,32:16,32:33,contradiction so lets look at our three contradiction so lets look at our three well draw it out and some particular well draw it out and some particular well draw it out and some particular reds e which is the maximum weighted reds e which is the maximum weighted reds e which is the maximum weighted edge of some particular cycle is present
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,32:33,32:40,edge of some particular cycle is present edge of some particular cycle is present ok suppose this was that particular edge ok suppose this was that particular edge ok suppose this was that particular edge if you remove that particular edge that if you remove that particular edge that if you remove that particular edge that tree will automatically break into two
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,32:40,32:48,tree will automatically break into two tree will automatically break into two parts okay so thats going to naturally parts okay so thats going to naturally parts okay so thats going to naturally give us a cut involving or a partition give us a cut involving or a partition give us a cut involving or a partition of the vertices so lets say were going
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,32:48,32:55,of the vertices so lets say were going of the vertices so lets say were going to draw a tree like this this is our to draw a tree like this this is our to draw a tree like this this is our edge uv and there are no other edge
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,32:55,33:02,edge uv and there are no other edge edge uv and there are no other edge going from side a to side b in the tree going from side a to side b in the tree going from side a to side b in the tree so there are all these other vertices
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,33:02,33:06,so there are all these other vertices so there are all these other vertices they are all connected to you and there they are all connected to you and there they are all connected to you and there are all these other vertices which are are all these other vertices which are
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,33:06,33:15,are all these other vertices which are connected to the well thats our tree connected to the well thats our tree connected to the well thats our tree our minimal spanning tree was something our minimal spanning tree was something our minimal spanning tree was something of this kind and if you remove uv then
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,33:15,33:23,of this kind and if you remove uv then of this kind and if you remove uv then that disconnects the graph but now if that disconnects the graph but now if that disconnects the graph but now if you think of the original cycle c of you think of the original cycle c of
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,33:23,33:29,you think of the original cycle c of which uv was a maximum edge if you look which uv was a maximum edge if you look which uv was a maximum edge if you look at that cycle and trace out that cycle at that cycle and trace out that cycle
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,33:29,33:39,at that cycle and trace out that cycle starting at the edge uv then at some starting at the edge uv then at some starting at the edge uv then at some point there should be an edge going back point there should be an edge going back point there should be an edge going back into im going from b to a the cycle of
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,33:39,33:47,into im going from b to a the cycle of into im going from b to a the cycle of which the edge e was part of must have which the edge e was part of must have which the edge e was part of must have an edge which goes from b to a ok and
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,33:47,33:54,an edge which goes from b to a ok and an edge which goes from b to a ok and clearly this is not going to be an edge clearly this is not going to be an edge clearly this is not going to be an edge that was part of the treaty because
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,33:54,34:01,that was part of the treaty because that was part of the treaty because the treaty did not have any edge going the treaty did not have any edge going the treaty did not have any edge going from side a to side b other than the uv from side a to side b other than the uv
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,34:01,34:08,from side a to side b other than the uv edge okay so lets call this edge as t edge okay so lets call this edge as t edge okay so lets call this edge as t prime okay and since this is part of the prime okay and since this is part of the
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,34:08,34:14,prime okay and since this is part of the cycle weight of a prime this is going to cycle weight of a prime this is going to cycle weight of a prime this is going to be strictly less than weight of uv again be strictly less than weight of uv again
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,34:14,34:27,be strictly less than weight of uv again replacing the edge e prime replacing the replacing the edge e prime replacing the replacing the edge e prime replacing the edge e with e prime we get a tree of edge e with e prime we get a tree of edge e with e prime we get a tree of strictly less weight okay so we can
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,34:27,34:34,strictly less weight okay so we can strictly less weight okay so we can conclude that t is not minimal its not conclude that t is not minimal its not conclude that t is not minimal its not the minimal spanning tree okay and the minimal spanning tree okay and
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,34:34,34:44,the minimal spanning tree okay and therefore our assumption is therefore our assumption is therefore our assumption is contradictory okay so we know that cycle contradictory okay so we know that cycle contradictory okay so we know that cycle property is also true so now equipped property is also true so now equipped
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,34:44,34:52,property is also true so now equipped with these two properties cycling with these two properties cycling with these two properties cycling property and cut property we will property and cut property we will property and cut property we will describe a couple of algorithms to solve describe a couple of algorithms to solve
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,34:52,34:58,describe a couple of algorithms to solve the minimal spanning tree problem okay the minimal spanning tree problem okay the minimal spanning tree problem okay when while spreading through problem is when while spreading through problem is when while spreading through problem is youre given some particular graph some youre given some particular graph some
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,34:58,35:06,youre given some particular graph some particular weighted graph and you need particular weighted graph and you need particular weighted graph and you need to compute the minimal spanning tree and to compute the minimal spanning tree and to compute the minimal spanning tree and these are classic algorithms the first
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,35:06,35:15,these are classic algorithms the first these are classic algorithms the first algorithm is called as kruskals algorithm is called as kruskals algorithm is called as kruskals algorithm we wont bother about the data algorithm we wont bother about the data algorithm we wont bother about the data structures used in these algorithms but
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,35:15,35:22,structures used in these algorithms but structures used in these algorithms but instead well just look at the steps of instead well just look at the steps of instead well just look at the steps of the algorithm so crystals algorithm does the algorithm so crystals algorithm does the algorithm so crystals algorithm does the following you look at all the edges
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,35:22,35:37,the following you look at all the edges the following you look at all the edges sorted by their weights in increasing sorted by their weights in increasing sorted by their weights in increasing order okay so consider edges in order okay so consider edges in order okay so consider edges in increasing order of their weights
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,35:37,35:47,okay so e e and so on okay so e e and so on there were m edges then you look at it there were m edges then you look at it there were m edges then you look at it just even e yep and keep on adding this
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,35:47,35:53,just even e yep and keep on adding this just even e yep and keep on adding this into the tree into the tree into the tree okay so initially you have these n okay so initially you have these n okay so initially you have these n vertices which we can think of as
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,35:53,36:01,vertices which we can think of as vertices which we can think of as isolated vertices first vertex first isolated vertices first vertex first isolated vertices first vertex first edge that you add is even and then maybe edge that you add is even and then maybe edge that you add is even and then maybe you will add e to and so on each time
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,36:01,36:07,you will add e to and so on each time you will add e to and so on each time you are adding an edge you will check if you are adding an edge you will check if you are adding an edge you will check if there is a cycle formed by the edges
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,36:07,36:14,there is a cycle formed by the edges there is a cycle formed by the edges that are already that are already that are already so suppose even need to and then you so suppose even need to and then you so suppose even need to and then you added iii and suppose ii for was between
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,36:14,36:20,added iii and suppose ii for was between added iii and suppose ii for was between these then you are not going to add it these then you are not going to add it these then you are not going to add it for okay so consider the edges in these
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,36:20,36:34,for okay so consider the edges in these for okay so consider the edges in these orders keep adding them without creating orders keep adding them without creating orders keep adding them without creating cycles okay and in the end if you had cycles okay and in the end if you had
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,36:34,36:43,cycles okay and in the end if you had started with a connected graph you will started with a connected graph you will started with a connected graph you will get the minimal spanning tree okay why get the minimal spanning tree okay why get the minimal spanning tree okay why is this algorithm correct the reason is
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,36:43,36:55,is this algorithm correct the reason is is this algorithm correct the reason is the sightly property now every edge that the sightly property now every edge that the sightly property now every edge that we have removed from this particular we have removed from this particular we have removed from this particular tree is an edge which deserved to be
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,36:55,37:03,tree is an edge which deserved to be tree is an edge which deserved to be removed because that cannot be part of removed because that cannot be part of removed because that cannot be part of any minimal spanning tree this also any minimal spanning tree this also any minimal spanning tree this also tells us that if the edge weights were
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,37:03,37:08,tells us that if the edge weights were tells us that if the edge weights were distinct that gives rise to unique distinct that gives rise to unique distinct that gives rise to unique ordering on the edges and therefore it ordering on the edges and therefore it ordering on the edges and therefore it will create a unique minimal spanning
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,37:08,37:16,will create a unique minimal spanning will create a unique minimal spanning tree okay so on graphs where the edge tree okay so on graphs where the edge tree okay so on graphs where the edge weights are distinct there is precisely weights are distinct there is precisely weights are distinct there is precisely one minimal spanning tree and that can
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,37:16,37:23,one minimal spanning tree and that can one minimal spanning tree and that can be found by this method methods be found by this method methods be found by this method methods correctness restaurants the fact that correctness restaurants the fact that correctness restaurants the fact that all the edges that we have removed in
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,37:23,37:28,all the edges that we have removed in all the edges that we have removed in the process to create that tree can i the process to create that tree can i the process to create that tree can i mean those are the edges which cannot be mean those are the edges which cannot be
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,37:28,37:44,mean those are the edges which cannot be present in any minimal spanning tree okay so if we look at our original graph okay so if we look at our original graph okay so if we sorted the edges according okay so if we sorted the edges according okay so if we sorted the edges according to the edge weights the edge weights
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,37:44,38:03,to the edge weights the edge weights to the edge weights the edge weights would have been ok we would have been ok we would have been ok we need to have some way of identifying need to have some way of identifying need to have some way of identifying which was the weight to edge okay but if
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,38:03,38:08,which was the weight to edge okay but if which was the weight to edge okay but if you look at weight amp these edges are you look at weight amp these edges are you look at weight amp these edges are will automatically be added this also will automatically be added this also
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,38:08,38:14,will automatically be added this also can be added and you add theres a can be added and you add theres a can be added and you add theres a cycle so thats not going to be added cycle so thats not going to be added cycle so thats not going to be added when you add thats not going to
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,38:14,38:18,when you add thats not going to when you add thats not going to create a cycle that gets added the next create a cycle that gets added the next create a cycle that gets added the next is also going to be added and amp is also going to be added and amp
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,38:18,38:25,is also going to be added and amp are going to create cycles okay and are going to create cycles okay and are going to create cycles okay and therefore they will not be therefore they will not be therefore they will not be and therefore this example verified that
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,38:25,38:34,and therefore this example verified that and therefore this example verified that the tree obtained is indeed the minimal the tree obtained is indeed the minimal the tree obtained is indeed the minimal spanning tree prims algorithm is also a spanning tree prims algorithm is also a spanning tree prims algorithm is also a very simple way of constructing the
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,38:34,38:50,very simple way of constructing the very simple way of constructing the minimal spanning tree so you started in the algorithm works in so you started in the algorithm works in the following way you start at one the following way you start at one the following way you start at one particular vertex and look at all its
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,38:50,39:01,particular vertex and look at all its particular vertex and look at all its neighbors and amongst the neighbors add neighbors and amongst the neighbors add neighbors and amongst the neighbors add the least weighted edge okay and keep on the least weighted edge okay and keep on the least weighted edge okay and keep on and then lets say if you have added one
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,39:01,39:06,and then lets say if you have added one and then lets say if you have added one particular vertex now you consider this particular vertex now you consider this particular vertex now you consider this as a set and from this collection find as a set and from this collection find
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,39:06,39:12,as a set and from this collection find out the least weight arrange and then out the least weight arrange and then out the least weight arrange and then add that and then consider those three add that and then consider those three add that and then consider those three as a set and add the least weight edge
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,39:12,39:18,as a set and add the least weight edge as a set and add the least weight edge and so on okay so at any stage you have and so on okay so at any stage you have and so on okay so at any stage you have a collection of edges collection of
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,39:18,39:24,a collection of edges collection of a collection of edges collection of vertices which are which forms a vertices which are which forms a vertices which are which forms a connected component and from this connected component and from this connected component and from this component look at the least weighted
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,39:24,39:31,component look at the least weighted component look at the least weighted outgoing edge and thats what we added outgoing edge and thats what we added outgoing edge and thats what we added to expand this particular tree and in to expand this particular tree and in to expand this particular tree and in the end you will get the you will get a
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,39:31,39:35,the end you will get the you will get a the end you will get the you will get a tree and that tree is guaranteed to be tree and that tree is guaranteed to be tree and that tree is guaranteed to be the minimal spanning tree why is it the
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,39:35,39:41,the minimal spanning tree why is it the the minimal spanning tree why is it the minimal spanning tree because each edge minimal spanning tree because each edge minimal spanning tree because each edge that you add at any given stage is the that you add at any given stage is the
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,39:41,39:49,that you add at any given stage is the minimum weighted edge of a certain cut minimum weighted edge of a certain cut minimum weighted edge of a certain cut so when you added the first edge if you so when you added the first edge if you so when you added the first edge if you look at the cut consisting of just that
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,39:49,39:54,look at the cut consisting of just that look at the cut consisting of just that one vertex and everything else in the one vertex and everything else in the one vertex and everything else in the other side okay you have a valid reason other side okay you have a valid reason
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,39:54,40:01,other side okay you have a valid reason for adding the particular is it youve for adding the particular is it youve for adding the particular is it youve got it got it got it at any particular stage you have some at any particular stage you have some at any particular stage you have some partial tree and those partial trees
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,40:01,40:09,partial tree and those partial trees partial tree and those partial trees define a set of vertices and the define a set of vertices and the define a set of vertices and the complement of that would be the other complement of that would be the other complement of that would be the other part so if you cancel this is a cut a be
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,40:09,40:13,part so if you cancel this is a cut a be part so if you cancel this is a cut a be the next edge that you are going to add the next edge that you are going to add the next edge that you are going to add is the minimum weighted edge across the
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,40:13,40:18,is the minimum weighted edge across the is the minimum weighted edge across the cut a b and therefore by cut property cut a b and therefore by cut property cut a b and therefore by cut property that is an edge which deserve to be that is an edge which deserve to be
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,40:18,40:24,that is an edge which deserve to be added to every minimal spanning tree added to every minimal spanning tree added to every minimal spanning tree okay so weve learnt two algorithms to okay so weve learnt two algorithms to okay so weve learnt two algorithms to compute the minimum spanning tree and
212.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,40:24,40:29,compute the minimum spanning tree and compute the minimum spanning tree and the correctness of both these algorithm the correctness of both these algorithm the correctness of both these algorithm comes from simple properties simply comes from simple properties simply comes from simple properties simply graphs properties like cut property

213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,0:40,0:55,and then we will look at something and then we will look at something called as matching we will look at these called as matching we will look at these called as matching we will look at these properties with respect to bipartite properties with respect to bipartite properties with respect to bipartite graphs okay so let us see what is edge
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,0:55,1:10,graphs okay so let us see what is edge graphs okay so let us see what is edge coloring in a graph so lets take an coloring in a graph so lets take an coloring in a graph so lets take an example this is a graph on five vertices
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,1:10,1:33,the objective is to color the edges let the objective is to color the edges let us give each edge some color the us give each edge some color the us give each edge some color the restriction is adjacent edges should restriction is adjacent edges should restriction is adjacent edges should have different colors so write it in the
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,1:33,2:01,have different colors so write it in the have different colors so write it in the following way so we require two things first color so we require two things first color every edge and second edges sharing a every edge and second edges sharing a every edge and second edges sharing a vertex
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,2:01,2:21,so any such coloring will be called as a so any such coloring will be called as a valid edge coloring we want to find an valid edge coloring we want to find an valid edge coloring we want to find an edge coloring which minimizes the number edge coloring which minimizes the number
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,2:21,2:28,edge coloring which minimizes the number of colors used we could of course give of colors used we could of course give of colors used we could of course give different colors distinct colors to each different colors distinct colors to each different colors distinct colors to each edge and surely all the properties would
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,2:28,2:35,edge and surely all the properties would edge and surely all the properties would be met but that does not minimize the be met but that does not minimize the be met but that does not minimize the number of colors used one thing that we number of colors used one thing that we
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,2:35,2:44,number of colors used one thing that we can see is for this particular graph we can see is for this particular graph we can see is for this particular graph we would require at least three colors would require at least three colors would require at least three colors because there are some vertices whose
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,2:44,2:52,because there are some vertices whose because there are some vertices whose degree is now the question is can we degree is now the question is can we degree is now the question is can we do it in exactly three to is impossible do it in exactly three to is impossible
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,2:52,2:59,do it in exactly three to is impossible because since there is a vertex of because since there is a vertex of because since there is a vertex of degree three all the three edges should degree three all the three edges should degree three all the three edges should get distinct colors so lets see if we
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,2:59,3:06,get distinct colors so lets see if we get distinct colors so lets see if we can do that so this is red lets say can do that so this is red lets say can do that so this is red lets say this is given blue color and the third
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,3:06,3:17,this is given blue color and the third this is given blue color and the third is given green color now the one is given green color now the one is given green color now the one forehead could be given green color and forehead could be given green color and
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,3:17,3:37,forehead could be given green color and could now be given its a red color could now be given its a red color could now be given its a red color and must be given blue color okay and now if you look at vertex three okay and now if you look at vertex three there are two colors already being used
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,3:37,3:45,there are two colors already being used there are two colors already being used there blue and green there blue and green there blue and green so the which cannot be blue or green so the which cannot be blue or green so the which cannot be blue or green and because the edge is using red
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,3:45,3:49,and because the edge is using red and because the edge is using red color this cannot be read either so color this cannot be read either so color this cannot be read either so maybe we will have to use a different maybe we will have to use a different
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,3:49,3:57,maybe we will have to use a different color lets say if we use a pink color color lets say if we use a pink color color lets say if we use a pink color and this is a valid coloring so here we and this is a valid coloring so here we
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,3:57,4:05,and this is a valid coloring so here we are required for but as for really are required for but as for really are required for but as for really required there was four colors used can required there was four colors used can required there was four colors used can we do with three colors is a question
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,4:05,4:13,we do with three colors is a question we do with three colors is a question and we want to answer this question for and we want to answer this question for and we want to answer this question for bipartite graph so the specific question bipartite graph so the specific question
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,4:13,4:21,bipartite graph so the specific question that we will look at us is the number of that we will look at us is the number of that we will look at us is the number of colors required to each color a graph colors required to each color a graph
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,4:21,4:31,colors required to each color a graph equal to its maximum equal to its maximum equal to its maximum degree so every graph will have a degree so every graph will have a degree so every graph will have a maximum degree and will the number of maximum degree and will the number of
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,4:31,4:39,maximum degree and will the number of colors required to each color be equal colors required to each color be equal colors required to each color be equal to the max degree clearly in general to the max degree clearly in general to the max degree clearly in general graphs this is not the case for example
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,4:39,4:43,graphs this is not the case for example graphs this is not the case for example we could take just the five cycle so in we could take just the five cycle so in we could take just the five cycle so in this example that we had considered its
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,4:43,4:51,this example that we had considered its this example that we had considered its not clear that we require four maybe not clear that we require four maybe not clear that we require four maybe there is a coloring which requires s there is a coloring which requires s there is a coloring which requires s you can think about that but we can
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,4:51,5:04,you can think about that but we can you can think about that but we can construct examples where the max degree construct examples where the max degree construct examples where the max degree of the vertex is not sufficient for of the vertex is not sufficient for of the vertex is not sufficient for example if we took this particular graph
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,5:04,5:18,this is the five cycle the degree of any this is the five cycle the degree of any vertex is only two but we can argue that vertex is only two but we can argue that vertex is only two but we can argue that two colors will not suffice to edds
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,5:18,5:30,two colors will not suffice to edds two colors will not suffice to edds color this graph because we can without color this graph because we can without color this graph because we can without loss of generality assume that if that loss of generality assume that if that loss of generality assume that if that one of the edges is colored blue and
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,5:30,5:42,then its neighboring edges have to be then its neighboring edges have to be colored using a different color so lets colored using a different color so lets colored using a different color so lets say that is red and its neighboring has say that is red and its neighboring has
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,5:42,5:49,say that is red and its neighboring has to be colored using blue if you use any to be colored using blue if you use any to be colored using blue if you use any other color youre exceeding the number other color youre exceeding the number other color youre exceeding the number of colors but there are two neighbors
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,5:49,5:54,of colors but there are two neighbors of colors but there are two neighbors and both of them cannot be given blue and both of them cannot be given blue and both of them cannot be given blue color because of the construction of color because of the construction of
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,5:54,6:04,color because of the construction of this graph this graph this graph so in general graph there you can so in general graph there you can so in general graph there you can construct examples where max degree is construct examples where max degree is construct examples where max degree is not equal to the number of colors
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,6:04,6:40,not equal to the number of colors not equal to the number of colors required to each color so we can required to each color so we can required to each color so we can summarize that the following way max degree can be less than the number max degree can be less than the number of colors required to edge color okay in
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,6:40,6:45,of colors required to edge color okay in of colors required to edge color okay in the general graph this could be the case the general graph this could be the case the general graph this could be the case the c or any odd cycle is an example the c or any odd cycle is an example
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,6:45,6:55,the c or any odd cycle is an example where this max degree is less than the where this max degree is less than the where this max degree is less than the number of colors required to h color now number of colors required to h color now number of colors required to h color now lets focus on just bipartite graph if
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,6:55,7:07,lets focus on just bipartite graph if lets focus on just bipartite graph if we restrict our attention to bipartite we restrict our attention to bipartite we restrict our attention to bipartite graph can every bipartite graph be graph can every bipartite graph be graph can every bipartite graph be colored with number of colors which is
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,7:07,7:11,colored with number of colors which is colored with number of colors which is equal to the max degree we will show equal to the max degree we will show equal to the max degree we will show that this will show that this is the that this will show that this is the
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,7:11,7:32,that this will show that this is the case okay so this is a theorem that we case okay so this is a theorem that we case okay so this is a theorem that we will prove so let g be a bipartite graph number of colors required to each color
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,7:32,7:51,number of colors required to each color g is equal to max degree of g why is g is equal to max degree of g why is g is equal to max degree of g why is this so whats the proof okay so first of all what is a bipartite
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,7:51,7:59,okay so first of all what is a bipartite graph you can split the vertices into graph you can split the vertices into graph you can split the vertices into two parts lets say x and y okay so if two parts lets say x and y okay so if
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,7:59,8:05,two parts lets say x and y okay so if you think of gs v comma e where v is the you think of gs v comma e where v is the you think of gs v comma e where v is the set of vertices and the e is the set of
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,8:05,8:17,set of vertices and the e is the set of set of vertices and the e is the set of edges we can be written as x union y so edges we can be written as x union y so edges we can be written as x union y so this is a disjoint union because they
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,8:17,8:23,this is a disjoint union because they this is a disjoint union because they dont share any vertices so v can be the dont share any vertices so v can be the dont share any vertices so v can be the vertex set can be split as x union y
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,8:23,8:37,vertex set can be split as x union y vertex set can be split as x union y such that all edges are between x and y okay so you cannot have an edge of this okay so you cannot have an edge of this kind from x to itself so this is
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,8:37,8:41,kind from x to itself so this is kind from x to itself so this is forbidden and you cannot have an edge forbidden and you cannot have an edge forbidden and you cannot have an edge from y to itself this is also forbidden from y to itself this is also forbidden
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,8:41,8:48,from y to itself this is also forbidden so all the edges go from x to y thats so all the edges go from x to y thats so all the edges go from x to y thats the definition of a bipartite graph so the definition of a bipartite graph so
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,8:48,8:54,the definition of a bipartite graph so if we look at a bipartite graph we want if we look at a bipartite graph we want if we look at a bipartite graph we want to show that the max degree is equal to to show that the max degree is equal to
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,8:54,9:02,to show that the max degree is equal to the number of colors required to edge the number of colors required to edge the number of colors required to edge color the graph okay so clearly we can color the graph okay so clearly we can color the graph okay so clearly we can see one one direction that does you
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,9:02,9:17,see one one direction that does you see one one direction that does you require at least those many colors so require at least those many colors so require at least those many colors so let delta be the max degree number of let delta be the max degree number of
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,9:17,9:28,let delta be the max degree number of colors required is going to be greater colors required is going to be greater colors required is going to be greater than or equal to delta because at least than or equal to delta because at least than or equal to delta because at least delta is required this is because look
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,9:28,9:37,delta is required this is because look delta is required this is because look at that particular vertex with degree at that particular vertex with degree at that particular vertex with degree delta each of these edges must get delta each of these edges must get delta each of these edges must get distinct colors so number of colors
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,9:37,9:45,distinct colors so number of colors distinct colors so number of colors required definitely is greater than or required definitely is greater than or required definitely is greater than or equal to delta now if we can show that equal to delta now if we can show that equal to delta now if we can show that there exists a coloring which uses no
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,9:45,9:50,there exists a coloring which uses no there exists a coloring which uses no more than delta colors then it means more than delta colors then it means more than delta colors then it means that the minimum number so this is the that the minimum number so this is the
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,9:50,10:01,that the minimum number so this is the mean number of colors required so thats mean number of colors required so thats mean number of colors required so thats going to be equal to delta okay so how going to be equal to delta okay so how going to be equal to delta okay so how do we show that thats the case
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,10:01,10:29,do we show that thats the case do we show that thats the case okay so proof will be by induction we will induct on the number of edges in will induct on the number of edges in the graph okay suppose we denote the number of okay suppose we denote the number of edges by m when m is equal to one so
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,10:29,10:36,edges by m when m is equal to one so edges by m when m is equal to one so this is the base case m equals one would this is the base case m equals one would this is the base case m equals one would mean that this is a bipartite graph
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,10:36,10:42,mean that this is a bipartite graph mean that this is a bipartite graph would sing with a single edge and you would sing with a single edge and you would sing with a single edge and you require only one color okay so you can require only one color okay so you can
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,10:42,10:48,require only one color okay so you can think of that as a trivial case to cover think of that as a trivial case to cover think of that as a trivial case to cover it requires just one color so we will it requires just one color so we will
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,10:48,11:16,it requires just one color so we will assume that the statement is true for assume that the statement is true for assume that the statement is true for all graphs or bipartite graphs with at all graphs or bipartite graphs with at all graphs or bipartite graphs with at most m edges
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,11:16,11:28,now we will look at a graph with n plus now we will look at a graph with n plus edges and show that it can be colored edges and show that it can be colored edges and show that it can be colored using delta colors ok so let g be a
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,11:28,11:43,using delta colors ok so let g be a using delta colors ok so let g be a graph on m plus edges ok so now this graph on m plus edges ok so now this graph on m plus edges ok so now this is some bipartite graph we can just
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,11:43,11:52,is some bipartite graph we can just is some bipartite graph we can just remove one edge from g so to remove a remove one edge from g so to remove a remove one edge from g so to remove a particular edge any arbitrary age so let particular edge any arbitrary age so let
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,11:52,12:02,particular edge any arbitrary age so let us call that as the edge x comma y from us call that as the edge x comma y from us call that as the edge x comma y from g to obtain g prime so we just removed g to obtain g prime so we just removed
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,12:02,12:09,g to obtain g prime so we just removed one particular edge some arbitrary edge one particular edge some arbitrary edge one particular edge some arbitrary edge and we will get a smaller graph clearly and we will get a smaller graph clearly and we will get a smaller graph clearly by our induction hypothesis on the
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,12:09,12:19,by our induction hypothesis on the by our induction hypothesis on the smaller graph g prime you can color it smaller graph g prime you can color it smaller graph g prime you can color it with delta colors ok so delta is the max with delta colors ok so delta is the max
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,12:19,12:33,with delta colors ok so delta is the max degree in g ok so clearly we can obtain degree in g ok so clearly we can obtain degree in g ok so clearly we can obtain a coloring of g prime which uses no more a coloring of g prime which uses no more
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,12:33,12:49,a coloring of g prime which uses no more than delta colors g prime can be colored than delta colors g prime can be colored than delta colors g prime can be colored using delta colors now lets look at using delta colors now lets look at using delta colors now lets look at these vertices x amp y thats
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,12:49,12:58,these vertices x amp y thats these vertices x amp y thats corresponding to the edges that we have corresponding to the edges that we have corresponding to the edges that we have removed this is an edge that has not removed this is an edge that has not removed this is an edge that has not been colored so g is the main graph and
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,12:58,13:05,been colored so g is the main graph and been colored so g is the main graph and g prime is a residual graph and if we g prime is a residual graph and if we g prime is a residual graph and if we add this edge xy we will get this is the
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,13:05,13:11,add this edge xy we will get this is the add this edge xy we will get this is the complete graph g now we need to color complete graph g now we need to color complete graph g now we need to color this and if we manage to color it
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,13:11,13:15,this and if we manage to color it this and if we manage to color it without using any additional color then without using any additional color then without using any additional color then we are done we will see how that can be we are done we will see how that can be
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,13:15,13:27,we are done we will see how that can be done now look at the vertex x its done now look at the vertex x its done now look at the vertex x its degrees at most delta in the original degrees at most delta in the original degrees at most delta in the original graph
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,13:27,13:49,graph graph since one edge has been removed the since one edge has been removed the since one edge has been removed the degree of x in g prime is at most delta degree of x in g prime is at most delta degree of x in g prime is at most delta minus one degree of both x and y so
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,13:49,13:56,minus one degree of both x and y so minus one degree of both x and y so there is an unused color left at x and y there is an unused color left at x and y there is an unused color left at x and y so if you look at the vertex x and y in
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,13:56,14:03,so if you look at the vertex x and y in so if you look at the vertex x and y in the graph g prime there is some color the graph g prime there is some color the graph g prime there is some color that is unused okay so let alpha be the
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,14:03,14:19,that is unused okay so let alpha be the that is unused okay so let alpha be the unused color at vertex x and beta be the unused color at vertex x and beta be the unused color at vertex x and beta be the anews color at vertex y ok so whatever
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,14:19,14:24,anews color at vertex y ok so whatever anews color at vertex y ok so whatever or those canoes colors there should be or those canoes colors there should be or those canoes colors there should be at least one because degree of x is at at least one because degree of x is at
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,14:24,14:35,at least one because degree of x is at most delta and since we are removing one most delta and since we are removing one most delta and since we are removing one edge at x we would have used only delta edge at x we would have used only delta
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,14:35,14:43,edge at x we would have used only delta minus colors i mean the maximum of minus colors i mean the maximum of minus colors i mean the maximum of delta minus colors the leftbehind delta minus colors the leftbehind delta minus colors the leftbehind color is what we will call as alpha now
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,14:43,14:47,color is what we will call as alpha now color is what we will call as alpha now the simple cases when there is alpha and the simple cases when there is alpha and the simple cases when there is alpha and beta are the same if alpha and beta
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,14:47,14:57,beta are the same if alpha and beta beta are the same if alpha and beta where both lets say equal then we can where both lets say equal then we can where both lets say equal then we can simply use that color to color the edge simply use that color to color the edge
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,14:57,15:17,simply use that color to color the edge xy so xy there is an unused color we can so xy there is an unused color we can just give that a newest color to that just give that a newest color to that just give that a newest color to that particular edge but when alpha and beta
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,15:17,15:21,particular edge but when alpha and beta particular edge but when alpha and beta are different we are in a little bit of are different we are in a little bit of are different we are in a little bit of trouble but we will see that that case trouble but we will see that that case
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,15:21,15:26,trouble but we will see that that case can also be dealt with what we will do can also be dealt with what we will do can also be dealt with what we will do is we will look at the coloring given by is we will look at the coloring given by
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,15:26,15:34,is we will look at the coloring given by g prime g prime was a smaller graph g prime g prime was a smaller graph g prime g prime was a smaller graph which we assumed i mean which by our which we assumed i mean which by our which we assumed i mean which by our assumption can be coloured because g
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,15:34,15:41,assumption can be coloured because g assumption can be coloured because g prime has at most m adjacent okay so now prime has at most m adjacent okay so now prime has at most m adjacent okay so now lets look at this vertex so x and y up lets look at this vertex so x and y up
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,15:41,15:47,lets look at this vertex so x and y up to vertices the color that was unused at to vertices the color that was unused at to vertices the color that was unused at x was alpha and the color that was x was alpha and the color that was
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,15:47,15:57,x was alpha and the color that was unused at y was betta no so alpha we unused at y was betta no so alpha we unused at y was betta no so alpha we will just denote it by red and beta we will just denote it by red and beta we
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,15:57,16:09,will just denote it by red and beta we will denote by blue now the red color will denote by blue now the red color will denote by blue now the red color was not used at x and blue color should was not used at x and blue color should
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,16:09,16:13,was not used at x and blue color should have been used at x so lets look at the have been used at x so lets look at the have been used at x so lets look at the blue colored edge from x to the other blue colored edge from x to the other
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,16:13,16:24,blue colored edge from x to the other side so that will go to some particular side so that will go to some particular side so that will go to some particular vertex which we will call as y okay now vertex which we will call as y okay now
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,16:24,16:34,vertex which we will call as y okay now if you look at vertex y there are two if you look at vertex y there are two if you look at vertex y there are two situation that is either a red edge situation that is either a red edge
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,16:34,16:42,situation that is either a red edge black to the other side or the red edges black to the other side or the red edges black to the other side or the red edges not used if the red edge is not used not used if the red edge is not used
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,16:42,16:49,not used if the red edge is not used then we will stop okay if the red edge then we will stop okay if the red edge then we will stop okay if the red edge is used we will take the red edge okay is used we will take the red edge okay
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,16:49,16:54,is used we will take the red edge okay so the red edge goes to some other place so the red edge goes to some other place so the red edge goes to some other place some of the vertex lets call that as x some of the vertex lets call that as x
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,16:54,17:01,some of the vertex lets call that as x and then from here you will go back why and then from here you will go back why and then from here you will go back why are blue edge and we will continue this are blue edge and we will continue this
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,17:01,17:13,are blue edge and we will continue this process okay so all that we are doing us will okay so all that we are doing us will the followings the followings the followings start at the vertex x and you go to the start at the vertex x and you go to the
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,17:13,17:20,start at the vertex x and you go to the other side via the blue edge if there is other side via the blue edge if there is other side via the blue edge if there is no blue edge then we will stop and when no blue edge then we will stop and when
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,17:20,17:24,no blue edge then we will stop and when you go to the other side you will come you go to the other side you will come you go to the other side you will come back why are they read it if you cannot back why are they read it if you cannot
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,17:24,17:29,back why are they read it if you cannot find the red edge you will stop okay so find the red edge you will stop okay so find the red edge you will stop okay so you will get an alternate path of red you will get an alternate path of red
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,17:29,17:37,you will get an alternate path of red and blue edges and blue edges and blue edges the claim is this process has to stop at the claim is this process has to stop at the claim is this process has to stop at some point and once this process stops
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,17:37,17:53,some point and once this process stops some point and once this process stops we can recolor this particular path we can recolor this particular path we can recolor this particular path without requiring additional colors so without requiring additional colors so without requiring additional colors so lets see how that can be done at any
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,17:53,18:00,lets see how that can be done at any lets see how that can be done at any point when we stop it means there is no point when we stop it means there is no point when we stop it means there is no ads to be taken for the other color okay
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,18:00,18:06,ads to be taken for the other color okay ads to be taken for the other color okay so what it means is if we could have so what it means is if we could have so what it means is if we could have changed the blues to red and the reds to
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,18:06,18:12,changed the blues to red and the reds to changed the blues to red and the reds to blue and still things would work fine blue and still things would work fine blue and still things would work fine okay is that so so lets say this is yn okay is that so so lets say this is yn
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,18:12,18:21,okay is that so so lets say this is yn and xn okay the process stopped at yn and xn okay the process stopped at yn and xn okay the process stopped at yn because there was no reds to take to go because there was no reds to take to go
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,18:21,18:29,because there was no reds to take to go to the other side that is guaranteed to the other side that is guaranteed to the other side that is guaranteed because this is a bipartite graph and because this is a bipartite graph and because this is a bipartite graph and because all the edges go to the other
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,18:29,18:38,because all the edges go to the other because all the edges go to the other side so you can change this back to red side so you can change this back to red side so you can change this back to red but if you change that back to red there
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,18:38,18:43,but if you change that back to red there but if you change that back to red there is a violation at xn but we can change is a violation at xn but we can change is a violation at xn but we can change that black to blue okay so we can
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,18:43,18:55,that black to blue okay so we can that black to blue okay so we can alternate in this particular manner and alternate in this particular manner and alternate in this particular manner and get another valid coloring okay so now get another valid coloring okay so now get another valid coloring okay so now what happens is initially the color that
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,18:55,19:05,what happens is initially the color that what happens is initially the color that was used at vertex x was blue and now was used at vertex x was blue and now was used at vertex x was blue and now that blue has changed to red and since that blue has changed to red and since
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,19:05,19:12,that blue has changed to red and since we initially assumed that red color was we initially assumed that red color was we initially assumed that red color was not used and the blue is now a free not used and the blue is now a free not used and the blue is now a free color so when blue is a free color
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,19:12,19:18,color so when blue is a free color color so when blue is a free color thats the same color that is free for thats the same color that is free for thats the same color that is free for vertex y and therefore we can color the vertex y and therefore we can color the
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,19:18,19:27,vertex y and therefore we can color the edge x y using the blue color edge x y using the blue color edge x y using the blue color okay so that is the thats a proof so okay so that is the thats a proof so okay so that is the thats a proof so lets just quickly recap the proof we
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,19:27,19:33,lets just quickly recap the proof we lets just quickly recap the proof we looked at the graph and we removed one looked at the graph and we removed one looked at the graph and we removed one particular edge this smaller graph can particular edge this smaller graph can
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,19:33,19:42,particular edge this smaller graph can be colored using delta colors now the be colored using delta colors now the be colored using delta colors now the larger graph that you get by introducing larger graph that you get by introducing larger graph that you get by introducing xy into the graph into the residual
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,19:42,19:52,xy into the graph into the residual xy into the graph into the residual graph can also be colored using delta graph can also be colored using delta graph can also be colored using delta colors because we could start at the colors because we could start at the colors because we could start at the vertex x and keep on alternating using
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,19:52,19:57,vertex x and keep on alternating using vertex x and keep on alternating using the two colors that were left unused at the two colors that were left unused at the two colors that were left unused at the vertices x and y and once you get the vertices x and y and once you get
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,19:57,20:05,the vertices x and y and once you get this alternating path of colors you can this alternating path of colors you can this alternating path of colors you can swap the colors on the path to recolor swap the colors on the path to recolor swap the colors on the path to recolor the edges once you have we colored the
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,20:05,20:12,the edges once you have we colored the the edges once you have we colored the edges the vertices x and y both will edges the vertices x and y both will edges the vertices x and y both will have the same unused color and that have the same unused color and that
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,20:12,20:20,have the same unused color and that color can be used for coloring the edge color can be used for coloring the edge color can be used for coloring the edge xy so we will now move on we look at xy so we will now move on we look at
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,20:20,20:47,xy so we will now move on we look at another property known as matching so matching is mean you can find so matching is mean you can find matching its in general graph but here matching its in general graph but here matching its in general graph but here were going to restrict our attention to
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,20:47,20:57,were going to restrict our attention to were going to restrict our attention to bipartite graphs so lets understand bipartite graphs so lets understand bipartite graphs so lets understand what is a matching well start with the what is a matching well start with the what is a matching well start with the jungle graphs itself so this is a graph
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,20:57,21:32,jungle graphs itself so this is a graph jungle graphs itself so this is a graph on vertices lets say volt is this a such that you do not share a vertex so such that you do not share a vertex so the red colored edges will basically the red colored edges will basically
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,21:32,21:47,the red colored edges will basically form a matching thats an example of a form a matching thats an example of a form a matching thats an example of a matching okay so i have drawn three red matching okay so i have drawn three red matching okay so i have drawn three red edges in this graph and this forms a
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,21:47,22:09,edges in this graph and this forms a edges in this graph and this forms a matching if you number the vertices if you number the vertices as one to if you number the vertices as one to seven the matching will consist of the seven the matching will consist of the
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,22:09,22:15,seven the matching will consist of the following add the matching will be following add the matching will be following add the matching will be described here using the red edges will described here using the red edges will described here using the red edges will consist of the following edges one two
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,22:15,22:21,consist of the following edges one two consist of the following edges one two four six and five seven look at any two four six and five seven look at any two four six and five seven look at any two pair of edges inside this collection pair of edges inside this collection
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,22:21,22:35,pair of edges inside this collection they do not share a vertex this is also they do not share a vertex this is also they do not share a vertex this is also a maximal matching in the sense this a maximal matching in the sense this a maximal matching in the sense this particular graph g if you call this
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,22:35,22:44,particular graph g if you call this particular graph g if you call this graph g this graph g cannot have a graph g this graph g cannot have a graph g this graph g cannot have a matching of size greater than it has matching of size greater than it has
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,22:44,22:53,matching of size greater than it has only seven vertices and each matching only seven vertices and each matching only seven vertices and each matching edge will take two vertices with it so edge will take two vertices with it so edge will take two vertices with it so the maximum number of such pairs that
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,22:53,23:00,the maximum number of such pairs that the maximum number of such pairs that you can obtain as certainly less than or you can obtain as certainly less than or you can obtain as certainly less than or equal to by and being a non equal to by and being a non
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,23:00,23:08,equal to by and being a non integer the maximum possible is only integer the maximum possible is only integer the maximum possible is only so is the maximal matching as well as so is the maximal matching as well as so is the maximal matching as well as the maximum matching so lets see few
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,23:08,23:44,the maximum matching so lets see few the maximum matching so lets see few other examples so we will look at these other examples so we will look at these other examples so we will look at these concepts more carefully maximal matching complete matching or perfect matchings complete matching or perfect matchings so maximal means there is no additional
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,23:44,23:50,so maximal means there is no additional so maximal means there is no additional edge that one can add to this collection edge that one can add to this collection edge that one can add to this collection that is given to you to get a matching that is given to you to get a matching
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,23:50,24:21,that is given to you to get a matching so lets see an example so if you look at this particular graph so if you look at this particular graph g and if you just look at the red edge if you look at the red edge that forms a
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,24:21,24:33,if you look at the red edge that forms a maximal matching because you cannot add maximal matching because you cannot add maximal matching because you cannot add any more edges to this collection any more edges to this collection any more edges to this collection without violating the matching property
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,24:33,24:52,because all the other edges must share a because all the other edges must share a vertex with either vertex or vertex vertex with either vertex or vertex vertex with either vertex or vertex but this is clearly not the maximum but this is clearly not the maximum but this is clearly not the maximum matching in the sense there are larger
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,24:52,25:04,matching in the sense there are larger matching in the sense there are larger matchings that can be obtained for matchings that can be obtained for matchings that can be obtained for example if you look at the blue colored example if you look at the blue colored example if you look at the blue colored edges thats an example of a maximum
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,25:04,25:13,edges thats an example of a maximum edges thats an example of a maximum matching and the sense this cannot be matching and the sense this cannot be matching and the sense this cannot be further extended and but there is not further extended and but there is not further extended and but there is not the unique maximum matching the pink
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,25:13,25:22,the unique maximum matching the pink the unique maximum matching the pink edges will also form a maximum matching edges will also form a maximum matching edges will also form a maximum matching in this case this is also a complete in this case this is also a complete in this case this is also a complete matching or a perfect matching because
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,25:22,25:38,matching or a perfect matching because matching or a perfect matching because all the vertices have been matched if we all the vertices have been matched if we all the vertices have been matched if we had looked at a different graph namely had looked at a different graph namely
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,25:38,25:52,had looked at a different graph namely the triangle the maximal matching as the triangle the maximal matching as the triangle the maximal matching as well as the maximum matching will well as the maximum matching will well as the maximum matching will consist of precisely one edge if you
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,25:52,25:59,consist of precisely one edge if you consist of precisely one edge if you take any particular edge thats going to take any particular edge thats going to take any particular edge thats going to be a maximum matching you cannot further be a maximum matching you cannot further be a maximum matching you cannot further extend it okay so you cannot get a
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,25:59,26:06,extend it okay so you cannot get a extend it okay so you cannot get a matching which covers all the vertices matching which covers all the vertices matching which covers all the vertices so there is no there are no complete so there is no there are no complete
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,26:06,26:15,so there is no there are no complete matchings in this particular graph what matchings in this particular graph what matchings in this particular graph what we will see in the remainder of this we will see in the remainder of this we will see in the remainder of this lecture is a characterization for when a
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,26:15,26:28,lecture is a characterization for when a lecture is a characterization for when a bipartite graph has a complete matching bipartite graph has a complete matching bipartite graph has a complete matching okay so this is the question that we okay so this is the question that we okay so this is the question that we will answer then theres
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,26:28,26:50,will answer then theres will answer then theres bipartite graph have a perfect matching okay so we will focus our written we okay so we will focus our written we will restrict our attention to bipartite will restrict our attention to bipartite will restrict our attention to bipartite graphs which have equal number of
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,26:50,26:57,graphs which have equal number of graphs which have equal number of vertices when we talk about perfect vertices when we talk about perfect vertices when we talk about perfect matchings because if one side had let us matchings because if one side had let us matchings because if one side had let us say seven vertices and the other side
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,26:57,27:07,say seven vertices and the other side say seven vertices and the other side had ten vertices we cannot clearly match had ten vertices we cannot clearly match had ten vertices we cannot clearly match all the all the vertices but we can hope all the all the vertices but we can hope
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,27:07,27:13,all the all the vertices but we can hope to match seven of them okay so if we to match seven of them okay so if we to match seven of them okay so if we match seven of them we could still call match seven of them we could still call
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,27:13,27:22,match seven of them we could still call that as a complete matching although that as a complete matching although that as a complete matching although its not a perfect matching so we will its not a perfect matching so we will its not a perfect matching so we will look at one side of the graph and we
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,27:22,27:27,look at one side of the graph and we look at one side of the graph and we will try and figure out when can all the will try and figure out when can all the will try and figure out when can all the vertices on one side be completely
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,27:27,27:34,vertices on one side be completely vertices on one side be completely matched we will call that as a complete matched we will call that as a complete matched we will call that as a complete matching the perfect matching case can matching the perfect matching case can matching the perfect matching case can be handled by this because all that you
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,27:34,27:40,be handled by this because all that you be handled by this because all that you have to check is the other side should have to check is the other side should have to check is the other side should contain an equal number of vertices so contain an equal number of vertices so
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,27:40,27:47,contain an equal number of vertices so if the other side contains seven if the other side contains seven if the other side contains seven vertices our our criterion will vertices our our criterion will vertices our our criterion will basically help us figure out whether it basically help us figure out whether it
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,27:47,27:58,basically help us figure out whether it has a perfect matching or not so the has a perfect matching or not so the has a perfect matching or not so the condition is given by halls theorem this condition is given by halls theorem this condition is given by halls theorem this is known as halls condition it will
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,27:58,28:11,is known as halls condition it will is known as halls condition it will require the notion of what is the require the notion of what is the require the notion of what is the neighbors of a vertex vertex to state neighbors of a vertex vertex to state neighbors of a vertex vertex to state this condition so you look at one
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,28:11,28:22,this condition so you look at one this condition so you look at one particular vertex its connected to many particular vertex its connected to many particular vertex its connected to many other vertices these vertices would be other vertices these vertices would be other vertices these vertices would be called as the neighbors of x and we will
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,28:22,28:30,called as the neighbors of x and we will called as the neighbors of x and we will denote it by n x okay so here x is a denote it by n x okay so here x is a denote it by n x okay so here x is a vertex and n x is a set of neighbors of
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,28:30,28:38,vertex and n x is a set of neighbors of vertex and n x is a set of neighbors of x if instead of vertex is a set of x if instead of vertex is a set of x if instead of vertex is a set of vertices so lets say s so this is a set
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,28:38,28:47,vertices so lets say s so this is a set vertices so lets say s so this is a set of vertices which of vertices which of vertices which well assume was nonempty and nests well assume was nonempty and nests well assume was nonempty and nests would be basically union of x belonging
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,28:47,28:57,would be basically union of x belonging would be basically union of x belonging to s and x so this is your set s and all to s and x so this is your set s and all to s and x so this is your set s and all the neighbors of this together would be
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,28:57,29:07,the neighbors of this together would be the neighbors of this together would be called s and s so clearly one can called s and s so clearly one can called s and s so clearly one can imagine that the number of neighbors is imagine that the number of neighbors is
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,29:07,29:17,imagine that the number of neighbors is strictly less than the number of strictly less than the number of strictly less than the number of elements in a set then there is no elements in a set then there is no elements in a set then there is no possibility of a complete matching
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,29:17,29:23,possibility of a complete matching possibility of a complete matching because those vertices cannot be matched because those vertices cannot be matched because those vertices cannot be matched it does not have enough number of it does not have enough number of it does not have enough number of counterparts on the other side if this

213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,31:07,31:15,graph g but one direction is very easy graph g but one direction is very easy if for some set s if size of that set is if for some set s if size of that set is if for some set s if size of that set is greater than the number of neighbors
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,31:15,31:25,greater than the number of neighbors greater than the number of neighbors then clearly that set at least cannot be then clearly that set at least cannot be then clearly that set at least cannot be matched so what we will prove purse when matched so what we will prove purse when
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,31:25,31:31,matched so what we will prove purse when n s is going to be greater than or equal n s is going to be greater than or equal n s is going to be greater than or equal to s for every subset s g will contain a to s for every subset s g will contain a
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,31:31,31:51,to s for every subset s g will contain a perfect matching okay so this is what we perfect matching okay so this is what we perfect matching okay so this is what we have to prove we will assume neighbors have to prove we will assume neighbors have to prove we will assume neighbors of s is a set of size larger than the

213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,33:14,33:46,of x now lets take a graph with mean we of x now lets take a graph with mean we will assume that statement is true for for all graphs with m vertices on the x for all graphs with m vertices on the x side all bipartite graphs so there are
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,33:46,33:59,side all bipartite graphs so there are side all bipartite graphs so there are two cases for all subsets of x nonempty two cases for all subsets of x nonempty two cases for all subsets of x nonempty subsets neighbors of s is greater than subsets neighbors of s is greater than

213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,34:07,34:22,size of s okay so now in this case we can just take any particular edge okay can just take any particular edge okay can just take any particular edge okay so let us say we choose one particular so let us say we choose one particular so let us say we choose one particular edge xy add it to the matching and now
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,34:22,34:26,edge xy add it to the matching and now edge xy add it to the matching and now look at the remaining graph that is the look at the remaining graph that is the look at the remaining graph that is the graph obtained by removing vertex graph obtained by removing vertex

213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,35:19,35:29,size of set so in case two there exists a set s such that neighbors of s its a set s such that neighbors of s its a set s such that neighbors of s its size is equal to the size of s okay this size is equal to the size of s okay this
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,35:29,35:37,size is equal to the size of s okay this is a slightly tricky case be careful is a slightly tricky case be careful is a slightly tricky case be careful about this so lets say this is our set about this so lets say this is our set about this so lets say this is our set x and this is our set y and we want to
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,35:37,35:43,x and this is our set y and we want to x and this is our set y and we want to find a perfect matching between these find a perfect matching between these find a perfect matching between these and we have a set s here so lets say
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,35:43,35:49,and we have a set s here so lets say and we have a set s here so lets say thats the top portion of this part x thats the top portion of this part x thats the top portion of this part x and the number of neighbors is exactly
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,35:49,35:54,and the number of neighbors is exactly and the number of neighbors is exactly equal to the size of s so lets say this equal to the size of s so lets say this equal to the size of s so lets say this is mapped to this particular region
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,35:54,36:02,is mapped to this particular region is mapped to this particular region because this is neighbors of s and we because this is neighbors of s and we because this is neighbors of s and we have size of s is equal to size of have size of s is equal to size of
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,36:02,36:09,have size of s is equal to size of neighbors of s now if we look at so this neighbors of s now if we look at so this neighbors of s now if we look at so this subset should be there exist a proper subset should be there exist a proper
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,36:09,36:25,subset should be there exist a proper subset were going to assume that s is a subset were going to assume that s is a subset were going to assume that s is a proper subset so our earlier case was i mean for every so our earlier case was i mean for every subset nfs was strictly greater and now
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,36:25,36:28,subset nfs was strictly greater and now subset nfs was strictly greater and now we are going to assume that there is a we are going to assume that there is a we are going to assume that there is a proper subset for which the size is proper subset for which the size is
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,36:28,36:36,proper subset for which the size is exactly same now this is the case let us exactly same now this is the case let us exactly same now this is the case let us restrict our attention to this set s we restrict our attention to this set s we
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,36:36,36:46,restrict our attention to this set s we can apply the induction hypothesis on can apply the induction hypothesis on can apply the induction hypothesis on this set s and get a perfect matching this set s and get a perfect matching this set s and get a perfect matching for s involving just neighbors of s so s
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,36:46,36:53,for s involving just neighbors of s so s for s involving just neighbors of s so s and n s now since s is a proper subset and n s now since s is a proper subset and n s now since s is a proper subset we know that the number of elements in s
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,36:53,37:00,we know that the number of elements in s we know that the number of elements in s is strictly less than the number of is strictly less than the number of is strictly less than the number of elements in x ok so si dennis can be elements in x ok so si dennis can be
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,37:00,37:16,elements in x ok so si dennis can be matched with our induction hypothesis why is this so look at s s a set i mean why is this so look at s s a set i mean so look at the news graph that you so look at the news graph that you
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,37:16,37:23,so look at the news graph that you obtained by considering just the obtained by considering just the obtained by considering just the vertices in s now that induced graph vertices in s now that induced graph vertices in s now that induced graph thats also going to be a bipartite
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,37:23,37:30,thats also going to be a bipartite thats also going to be a bipartite graph and that bipartite graph is going graph and that bipartite graph is going graph and that bipartite graph is going to be completely restricted to this to be completely restricted to this to be completely restricted to this portion because all the neighbors where
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,37:30,37:38,portion because all the neighbors where portion because all the neighbors where in n s of course there could be edges in n s of course there could be edges in n s of course there could be edges which come from neighbors of s the which come from neighbors of s the
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,37:38,37:50,which come from neighbors of s the remaining portion but those edges we are remaining portion but those edges we are remaining portion but those edges we are ignoring by just looking at sn dennis if ignoring by just looking at sn dennis if ignoring by just looking at sn dennis if you look at any subset of s its number
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,37:50,37:55,you look at any subset of s its number you look at any subset of s its number of neighbors when all its neighbors are of neighbors when all its neighbors are of neighbors when all its neighbors are going to line in is n s because n s was
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,37:55,38:01,going to line in is n s because n s was going to line in is n s because n s was the the neighbors of the entire set so the the neighbors of the entire set so the the neighbors of the entire set so any subsets neighbor should basically be
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,38:01,38:07,any subsets neighbor should basically be any subsets neighbor should basically be in n s and because of our condition that in n s and because of our condition that in n s and because of our condition that every subset had at least as many every subset had at least as many
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,38:07,38:17,every subset had at least as many neighbors as its size we know that every neighbors as its size we know that every neighbors as its size we know that every subset will also satisfy this property subset will also satisfy this property subset will also satisfy this property so if you look at a subset s prime
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,38:17,38:23,so if you look at a subset s prime so if you look at a subset s prime neighbors of s prime that set size is neighbors of s prime that set size is neighbors of s prime that set size is going to be greater than or equal to
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,38:23,38:30,going to be greater than or equal to going to be greater than or equal to size of s prime for every subset of s size of s prime for every subset of s size of s prime for every subset of s even while we are restricting to just
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,38:30,38:38,even while we are restricting to just even while we are restricting to just the graph the graph the graph why vertices s and ns okay so this why vertices s and ns okay so this why vertices s and ns okay so this portion involving the top half of x
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,38:38,38:44,portion involving the top half of x portion involving the top half of x involving s and ns they can be perfectly involving s and ns they can be perfectly involving s and ns they can be perfectly matched now what about the remaining matched now what about the remaining
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,38:44,38:52,matched now what about the remaining portion can the remaining set x be match portion can the remaining set x be match portion can the remaining set x be match to y the only problem is if we look at to y the only problem is if we look at
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,38:52,39:01,to y the only problem is if we look at subsets inside x lets call it as x subsets inside x lets call it as x subsets inside x lets call it as x prime they might have certain neighbors prime they might have certain neighbors prime they might have certain neighbors but some of those neighbors could be in
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,39:01,39:07,but some of those neighbors could be in but some of those neighbors could be in ns okay but we will show that thats ns okay but we will show that thats ns okay but we will show that thats even when some of the neighbors are in even when some of the neighbors are in
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,39:07,39:14,even when some of the neighbors are in ns our condition that ns is greater than ns our condition that ns is greater than ns our condition that ns is greater than the neighbors of x prime is a set of the neighbors of x prime is a set of
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,39:14,39:22,the neighbors of x prime is a set of size larger than the size of x prime size larger than the size of x prime size larger than the size of x prime will be a valid assumption okay so what will be a valid assumption okay so what will be a valid assumption okay so what we already what we have right now is s
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,39:22,39:38,we already what we have right now is s we already what we have right now is s and ns can be matched ok and what we and ns can be matched ok and what we and ns can be matched ok and what we need to show is x prime and n of x prime
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,39:38,40:05,so this is a diagram xs s was matched so this is a diagram xs s was matched to neighbors of s and this portion if we to neighbors of s and this portion if we to neighbors of s and this portion if we call it as x prime okay so x prime is
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,40:05,40:12,call it as x prime okay so x prime is call it as x prime okay so x prime is equal to x minus s and lets call the equal to x minus s and lets call the equal to x minus s and lets call the remaining portion as y prime here so y
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,40:12,40:22,remaining portion as y prime here so y remaining portion as y prime here so y prime is equal to y minus n s okay so we prime is equal to y minus n s okay so we prime is equal to y minus n s okay so we want to show that x prime and y prime
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,40:22,40:46,want to show that x prime and y prime want to show that x prime and y prime can be matched so we can apply induction hypothesis so we can apply induction hypothesis provided we can show that for all provided we can show that for all provided we can show that for all subsets a of xprime n of a is greater
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,40:46,40:53,subsets a of xprime n of a is greater subsets a of xprime n of a is greater than or equal to size of a this than or equal to size of a this than or equal to size of a this condition was true earlier but at that condition was true earlier but at that
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,40:53,40:58,condition was true earlier but at that time we would have been when we look at time we would have been when we look at time we would have been when we look at a subset of x prime and when we count a subset of x prime and when we count
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,40:58,41:05,a subset of x prime and when we count its neighbors some of those neighbors its neighbors some of those neighbors its neighbors some of those neighbors could be in ns but now we are allowed to could be in ns but now we are allowed to could be in ns but now we are allowed to count only those neighbors which belongs
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,41:05,41:11,count only those neighbors which belongs count only those neighbors which belongs to y prime okay but we will show that to y prime okay but we will show that to y prime okay but we will show that this condition is still true so why is this condition is still true so why is
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,41:11,41:21,this condition is still true so why is that so so lets assume the contrary that so so lets assume the contrary that so so lets assume the contrary suppose there is a subset a of x prime suppose there is a subset a of x prime suppose there is a subset a of x prime such that this condition is violated
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,41:21,41:34,such that this condition is violated such that this condition is violated okay suppose there exists a subset a of okay suppose there exists a subset a of okay suppose there exists a subset a of x prime such that n of a is strictly x prime such that n of a is strictly

213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,41:41,41:52,less than size of a then we will show that the razr subset in the original that the razr subset in the original that the razr subset in the original graph where halls condition was not met graph where halls condition was not met graph where halls condition was not met okay so the particular subset is easy to
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,41:52,42:11,okay so the particular subset is easy to okay so the particular subset is easy to construct lets look at a union s ok so construct lets look at a union s ok so construct lets look at a union s ok so a union s in g has how many neighbors
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,42:11,42:39,okay bye a resumption a union sampg had at okay bye a resumption a union sampg had at least as many neighbors as the size of a least as many neighbors as the size of a least as many neighbors as the size of a unionist okay neighbors of a union s its size is

213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,43:51,44:01,particular collection now neighbor of a particular collection now neighbor of a is when it is restricted to y prime okay is when it is restricted to y prime okay is when it is restricted to y prime okay so now n a union s its size n a union s
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,44:01,44:13,so now n a union s its size n a union s so now n a union s its size n a union s its equal to size of n a plus size of n its equal to size of n a plus size of n its equal to size of n a plus size of n s but size the venice we had it to be
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,44:13,44:21,s but size the venice we had it to be s but size the venice we had it to be equal to the size of s so this is equal equal to the size of s so this is equal equal to the size of s so this is equal to size of n a plus size of s and size

213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,44:27,44:36,so this is going to be less than size of so this is going to be less than size of a plus size of s so what we have here is a plus size of s so what we have here is a plus size of s so what we have here is and size of a plus size of s that is a
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,44:36,44:46,and size of a plus size of s that is a and size of a plus size of s that is a and s does not have any common element and s does not have any common element and s does not have any common element so that the size of a union s so here
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,44:46,44:58,we have the following inequality na we have the following inequality na union s this of size strictly smaller union s this of size strictly smaller union s this of size strictly smaller than a union s okay so that is the than a union s okay so that is the
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,44:58,45:04,than a union s okay so that is the contradiction and therefore our contradiction and therefore our contradiction and therefore our assumption is wrong namely where we assumption is wrong namely where we assumption is wrong namely where we assume that n of a is less than a is a
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,45:04,45:15,assume that n of a is less than a is a assume that n of a is less than a is a faulty assumption so that would mean n a faulty assumption so that would mean n a faulty assumption so that would mean n a is going to be greater than or equal to
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,45:15,45:27,is going to be greater than or equal to is going to be greater than or equal to a and now we can apply halls theorem to a and now we can apply halls theorem to a and now we can apply halls theorem to the smaller set x prime and we can get a
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,45:27,45:31,the smaller set x prime and we can get a the smaller set x prime and we can get a perfect matching we can get a matching perfect matching we can get a matching perfect matching we can get a matching of size x prime between x prime and y
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,45:31,45:35,of size x prime between x prime and y of size x prime between x prime and y prime combine these two matchings and prime combine these two matchings and prime combine these two matchings and you will get a matching in the whole you will get a matching in the whole
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,45:35,45:44,you will get a matching in the whole graph so what we have accomplished is graph so what we have accomplished is graph so what we have accomplished is the following in any bipartite graph if the following in any bipartite graph if the following in any bipartite graph if the number of neighbors of s is greater
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,45:44,45:50,the number of neighbors of s is greater the number of neighbors of s is greater than the number of elements in s for than the number of elements in s for than the number of elements in s for every subset of x where x is one side of
213.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,45:50,45:59,every subset of x where x is one side of every subset of x where x is one side of the graph then the graph will definitely the graph then the graph will definitely the graph then the graph will definitely have a perfect matching stop you

214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,2:24,2:38,question so we can reformulate this in a question so we can reformulate this in a graph theoretic fashion by asking the graph theoretic fashion by asking the graph theoretic fashion by asking the following graph is planar or non planar following graph is planar or non planar following graph is planar or non planar we could think of this is a b and c w
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,2:38,2:48,we could think of this is a b and c w we could think of this is a b and c w w w and we have the following graph w w and we have the following graph w w and we have the following graph with all these edges present we are
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,2:48,2:55,with all these edges present we are with all these edges present we are interested in knowing whether this graph interested in knowing whether this graph interested in knowing whether this graph can be embedded on the plane so we can can be embedded on the plane so we can
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,2:55,3:14,can be embedded on the plane so we can talk about what is called as a graph talk about what is called as a graph talk about what is called as a graph drawing a graph drawing we mean we have drawing a graph drawing we mean we have drawing a graph drawing we mean we have to find so position the vertices in the
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,3:14,3:34,to find so position the vertices in the to find so position the vertices in the plane and and if a comma b is an edge plane and and if a comma b is an edge plane and and if a comma b is an edge then connect them by a simple curve okay
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,3:34,3:40,then connect them by a simple curve okay then connect them by a simple curve okay and if we can find a graph drawing in and if we can find a graph drawing in and if we can find a graph drawing in such a way that the edges the curves
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,3:40,3:45,such a way that the edges the curves such a way that the edges the curves corresponding to the edges do not corresponding to the edges do not corresponding to the edges do not intersect then we say that the graph is intersect then we say that the graph is
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,3:45,4:26,intersect then we say that the graph is planar if we can find a graph drawing the graph is planar so now the puzzle the graph is planar so now the puzzle can be reformulated s is k thats the can be reformulated s is k thats the can be reformulated s is k thats the graph that we are interested in is it
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,4:26,4:35,graph that we are interested in is it graph that we are interested in is it planar planar planar okay so we will develop some tools by okay so we will develop some tools by okay so we will develop some tools by which we can answer this question we
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,4:35,4:41,which we can answer this question we which we can answer this question we will what we will show is that k is will what we will show is that k is will what we will show is that k is not planar and what will help us do that
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,4:41,4:49,not planar and what will help us do that not planar and what will help us do that is something known as the eulers is something known as the eulers is something known as the eulers theorem lets see one more example of theorem lets see one more example of
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,4:49,5:15,theorem lets see one more example of planarity so let us say we look at this planarity so let us say we look at this planarity so let us say we look at this particular graph on vertices okay so this is five vertices and nine okay so this is five vertices and nine edges its the complete graph from which
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,5:15,5:22,edges its the complete graph from which edges its the complete graph from which exactly one edge has been removed okay exactly one edge has been removed okay exactly one edge has been removed okay so we can write this is k minus one so we can write this is k minus one
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,5:22,5:33,so we can write this is k minus one particular edge lets say if we call particular edge lets say if we call particular edge lets say if we call that edges a b thats the graph that that edges a b thats the graph that that edges a b thats the graph that were looking at is this a planar graph
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,5:33,5:38,were looking at is this a planar graph were looking at is this a planar graph now if you look at it there are a lot of now if you look at it there are a lot of now if you look at it there are a lot of crossings in this as well so here there
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,5:38,5:43,crossings in this as well so here there crossings in this as well so here there is a crossing this is another crossing is a crossing this is another crossing is a crossing this is another crossing so there are lots of crossings in this so there are lots of crossings in this
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,5:43,5:51,so there are lots of crossings in this graph okay but can we redraw it in such graph okay but can we redraw it in such graph okay but can we redraw it in such a way that all the crossings can be a way that all the crossings can be
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,5:51,6:01,a way that all the crossings can be avoided in fact so what what im trying avoided in fact so what what im trying avoided in fact so what what im trying to emphasize is that if one drawing to emphasize is that if one drawing to emphasize is that if one drawing involves lot of crossing that doesnt
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,6:01,6:11,involves lot of crossing that doesnt involves lot of crossing that doesnt mean that we cannot redraw it to get mean that we cannot redraw it to get mean that we cannot redraw it to get another drawing where there are no another drawing where there are no another drawing where there are no crossing in this case we can do that and
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,6:11,6:17,crossing in this case we can do that and crossing in this case we can do that and that can be seen in as follows so that can be seen in as follows so that can be seen in as follows so theres an inner star which we can think
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,6:17,6:25,theres an inner star which we can think theres an inner star which we can think of it as a pentagon so a is connected to of it as a pentagon so a is connected to of it as a pentagon so a is connected to c is connected to e and e is connected
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,6:25,6:36,c is connected to e and e is connected c is connected to e and e is connected to b b is connected to d and d is to b b is connected to d and d is to b b is connected to d and d is connected to a so that takes care of the
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,6:36,6:40,connected to a so that takes care of the connected to a so that takes care of the inner pentagon so fiber just taken care inner pentagon so fiber just taken care inner pentagon so fiber just taken care of the other edges that are missing as of the other edges that are missing as
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,6:40,6:50,of the other edges that are missing as bc cd de and ei so those also we can bc cd de and ei so those also we can bc cd de and ei so those also we can draw bc is an edge and cd is an edge and draw bc is an edge and cd is an edge and
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,6:50,7:01,draw bc is an edge and cd is an edge and de is an edge draw it in this way and ea de is an edge draw it in this way and ea de is an edge draw it in this way and ea is an edge okay so this is an this is a
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,7:01,7:07,is an edge okay so this is an this is a is an edge okay so this is an this is a redrawing of the same graph in such a redrawing of the same graph in such a redrawing of the same graph in such a way that there are no crossings and once
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,7:07,7:12,way that there are no crossings and once way that there are no crossings and once we draw a graph that in this particular we draw a graph that in this particular we draw a graph that in this particular fashion thats called as a planar fashion thats called as a planar
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,7:12,7:27,fashion thats called as a planar embedding so what we see here is a embedding so what we see here is a embedding so what we see here is a planar embedding of the graph g now once we have a planar embedding let now once we have a planar embedding let us imagine then so we have the entire
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,7:27,7:32,us imagine then so we have the entire us imagine then so we have the entire plane and we have the these particular plane and we have the these particular plane and we have the these particular embedding and if you just remove the embedding and if you just remove the
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,7:32,7:45,embedding and if you just remove the edges and the vertices from this picture edges and the vertices from this picture edges and the vertices from this picture okay what happens is the plane may get okay what happens is the plane may get okay what happens is the plane may get split into disjoint portions so
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,7:45,7:54,split into disjoint portions so split into disjoint portions so basically you can think of this i see we basically you can think of this i see we basically you can think of this i see we are removing this particular region and are removing this particular region and are removing this particular region and we could ask this question how many
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,7:54,8:01,we could ask this question how many we could ask this question how many geographically connected regions would geographically connected regions would geographically connected regions would remain okay so we will give a name to remain okay so we will give a name to remain okay so we will give a name to those regions that will basically be
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,8:01,8:09,those regions that will basically be those regions that will basically be called as a face okay so here in this called as a face okay so here in this called as a face okay so here in this diagram there are going to be this is diagram there are going to be this is
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,8:09,8:31,diagram there are going to be this is one face and the green colored region is one face and the green colored region is one face and the green colored region is another face pink is going to be another another face pink is going to be another another face pink is going to be another face this is yet another face
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,8:31,8:40,okay so in all you can see that there okay so in all you can see that there are going to be one two three four five are going to be one two three four five are going to be one two three four five six phases the outside is also going to
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,8:40,8:49,six phases the outside is also going to six phases the outside is also going to be a face okay the outer region the be a face okay the outer region the be a face okay the outer region the entire outer region thats going to be entire outer region thats going to be
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,8:49,8:58,entire outer region thats going to be an infinite region thats going to be an infinite region thats going to be an infinite region thats going to be the sixth face okay so oilers theorem the sixth face okay so oilers theorem the sixth face okay so oilers theorem basically relates the number of faces
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,8:58,9:04,basically relates the number of faces basically relates the number of faces the number of edges and the number of the number of edges and the number of the number of edges and the number of vertices okay so let us state eulers vertices okay so let us state eulers
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,9:04,9:18,vertices okay so let us state eulers theorem before that lets write down the theorem before that lets write down the theorem before that lets write down the definition of a face so we will definition of a face so we will definition of a face so we will informally think of it as the connected
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,9:18,9:31,informally think of it as the connected informally think of it as the connected regions in planar graph drawing this is regions in planar graph drawing this is regions in planar graph drawing this is called a face so now we are in a called a face so now we are in a
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,9:31,9:43,called a face so now we are in a position to state the eulers planarity position to state the eulers planarity position to state the eulers planarity theorem so this says that the number of theorem so this says that the number of theorem so this says that the number of vertices so if v is the number of
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,9:43,9:48,vertices so if v is the number of vertices so if v is the number of vertices and e is the number of edges vertices and e is the number of edges vertices and e is the number of edges and f is the number of faces and v minus
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,9:48,10:15,and f is the number of faces and v minus and f is the number of faces and v minus e plus f will be equal to two because how do we prove this statement because how do we prove this statement the proof is fairly simple we can use an
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,10:15,10:36,the proof is fairly simple we can use an the proof is fairly simple we can use an induction on the number of edges so this will be true for connected so this will be true for connected graphs so take a connected graph it can graphs so take a connected graph it can
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,10:36,10:48,graphs so take a connected graph it can either be a cyclefree graph or it could either be a cyclefree graph or it could either be a cyclefree graph or it could contain cycles so we will split the contain cycles so we will split the contain cycles so we will split the proof into two parts so k is lets say
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,10:48,10:58,proof into two parts so k is lets say proof into two parts so k is lets say g is our graph the only other cases when g is our graph the only other cases when g is our graph the only other cases when g doesnt contain cycle so the connected
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,10:58,11:03,g doesnt contain cycle so the connected g doesnt contain cycle so the connected graph without cycles thats called as a graph without cycles thats called as a graph without cycles thats called as a tree so g is a tree now when you have a tree so g is a tree now when you have a
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,11:03,11:09,tree so g is a tree now when you have a tree and if you embed the tree into the tree and if you embed the tree into the tree and if you embed the tree into the plane then the rest it does not create plane then the rest it does not create
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,11:09,11:21,plane then the rest it does not create any regions and therefore the number of any regions and therefore the number of any regions and therefore the number of phases will be so case proof is easy phases will be so case proof is easy phases will be so case proof is easy v will be equal to number of vertices if
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,11:21,11:33,v will be equal to number of vertices if v will be equal to number of vertices if we call it as n and e will be equal to n we call it as n and e will be equal to n we call it as n and e will be equal to n minus and f will be equal to so v
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,11:33,11:41,minus and f will be equal to so v minus and f will be equal to so v minus e plus f will be n minus n minus minus e plus f will be n minus n minus minus e plus f will be n minus n minus plus and thats going to be equal to
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,11:41,11:47,plus and thats going to be equal to plus and thats going to be equal to thats the easy case another case is thats the easy case another case is thats the easy case another case is also fairly easy so if you have cycles also fairly easy so if you have cycles
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,11:47,11:57,also fairly easy so if you have cycles then one edge that is at least so if you then one edge that is at least so if you then one edge that is at least so if you have cycles and if you embed it youre have cycles and if you embed it youre
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,11:57,12:06,have cycles and if you embed it youre going to get some particular region going to get some particular region going to get some particular region which is a phase it could have any which is a phase it could have any which is a phase it could have any number of edges we dont bother about
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,12:06,12:11,number of edges we dont bother about number of edges we dont bother about how many edges are there in a particular how many edges are there in a particular how many edges are there in a particular phase but of course what we can conclude phase but of course what we can conclude
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,12:11,12:23,phase but of course what we can conclude is that there is going to be some is that there is going to be some is that there is going to be some particular edge which is part of some particular edge which is part of some particular edge which is part of some cycle and there are two phases on the
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,12:23,12:27,cycle and there are two phases on the cycle and there are two phases on the other side of this edge so lets say other side of this edge so lets say other side of this edge so lets say that thats f and f if you remove that thats f and f if you remove
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,12:27,12:36,that thats f and f if you remove this particular edge from the graph you this particular edge from the graph you this particular edge from the graph you will get a smaller graph and in that will get a smaller graph and in that will get a smaller graph and in that smaller graph what we can say is the
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,12:36,12:44,smaller graph what we can say is the smaller graph what we can say is the number of vertices do not change number number of vertices do not change number number of vertices do not change number of edges have reduced by one of edges have reduced by one of edges have reduced by one the faces f and f is going to coil as
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,12:44,12:52,the faces f and f is going to coil as the faces f and f is going to coil as interesting singlephase so we will now interesting singlephase so we will now interesting singlephase so we will now be n and e will be let us say me prime be n and e will be let us say me prime
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,12:52,12:57,be n and e will be let us say me prime so if you think of this as a reduced so if you think of this as a reduced so if you think of this as a reduced graph the number of vertices in the graph the number of vertices in the
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,12:57,13:06,graph the number of vertices in the reduced graph is the same as the reduced graph is the same as the reduced graph is the same as the original one and e prime will be equal original one and e prime will be equal original one and e prime will be equal to e minus and f prime will be f minus
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,13:06,13:17,to e minus and f prime will be f minus to e minus and f prime will be f minus and by induction hypothesis we can say and by induction hypothesis we can say and by induction hypothesis we can say that v prime minus e prime plus f must
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,13:17,13:25,that v prime minus e prime plus f must that v prime minus e prime plus f must be equal to plus f prime must be equal be equal to plus f prime must be equal be equal to plus f prime must be equal to so this is equal to v and this is
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,13:25,13:32,to so this is equal to v and this is to so this is equal to v and this is equal to e minus and this is equal to equal to e minus and this is equal to equal to e minus and this is equal to f minus ok so that can be rewritten as
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,13:32,13:38,f minus ok so that can be rewritten as f minus ok so that can be rewritten as v minus e plus f is equal to ok so v minus e plus f is equal to ok so v minus e plus f is equal to ok so thats a straightforward proof of
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,13:38,13:52,thats a straightforward proof of thats a straightforward proof of eulers planarity theorem lets try and eulers planarity theorem lets try and eulers planarity theorem lets try and show that k is not planar this is show that k is not planar this is show that k is not planar this is what we had this is our main objective
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,13:52,13:58,what we had this is our main objective what we had this is our main objective lets try and prove this in order to do lets try and prove this in order to do lets try and prove this in order to do that what we will we will try and derive
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,13:58,14:04,that what we will we will try and derive that what we will we will try and derive a corollary of eulers penality theorem a corollary of eulers penality theorem a corollary of eulers penality theorem so now if we look at simple graphs that so now if we look at simple graphs that
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,14:04,14:14,so now if we look at simple graphs that is graphs without self loops or parallel is graphs without self loops or parallel is graphs without self loops or parallel edges so let us look at any planar graph edges so let us look at any planar graph edges so let us look at any planar graph and any planar graph will have drawing
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,14:14,14:22,and any planar graph will have drawing and any planar graph will have drawing or an embedding in the plane now if you or an embedding in the plane now if you or an embedding in the plane now if you look at a particular edge any edge is look at a particular edge any edge is
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,14:22,14:30,look at a particular edge any edge is shared by at most two faces so lets shared by at most two faces so lets shared by at most two faces so lets look at a face and if you look at any look at a face and if you look at any
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,14:30,14:41,look at a face and if you look at any face there are some number of edges that face there are some number of edges that face there are some number of edges that is bounding this particular face ok so is bounding this particular face ok so is bounding this particular face ok so if this is a planar embedding of a graph
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,14:41,14:51,if this is a planar embedding of a graph if this is a planar embedding of a graph the number of faces here are let say the number of faces here are let say the number of faces here are let say this is f this is f left and the
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,14:51,15:00,this is f this is f left and the this is f this is f left and the outer face is f outer face is f outer face is f now if we look at f these edges e e now if we look at f these edges e e
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,15:00,15:09,now if we look at f these edges e e e e e and e are the boundary edges e e e and e are the boundary edges e e e and e are the boundary edges and you can do this for each particular and you can do this for each particular
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,15:09,15:24,and you can do this for each particular face for f the boundary edges are going face for f the boundary edges are going face for f the boundary edges are going to be e e d note that any edge to be e e d note that any edge
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,15:24,15:36,to be e e d note that any edge can act or serve as the boundary edge can act or serve as the boundary edge can act or serve as the boundary edge for at most two faces okay so so for at most two faces okay so so for at most two faces okay so so associated with each face we can have
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,15:36,15:49,associated with each face we can have associated with each face we can have this number f i this denotes the number this number f i this denotes the number this number f i this denotes the number of boundary edges so if you sum up these of boundary edges so if you sum up these
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,15:49,15:58,of boundary edges so if you sum up these fis over all the faces what you will get fis over all the faces what you will get fis over all the faces what you will get is times the number of edges okay now is times the number of edges okay now
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,15:58,16:05,is times the number of edges okay now if you take a simple graph each phase is if you take a simple graph each phase is if you take a simple graph each phase is going to have a boundary with at least going to have a boundary with at least
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,16:05,16:35,going to have a boundary with at least three edges for a simple graph every face will have at least three every face will have at least three edges okay so here in this we are edges okay so here in this we are edges okay so here in this we are assuming that every edges mean while
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,16:35,16:44,assuming that every edges mean while assuming that every edges mean while writing this particular formula we are writing this particular formula we are writing this particular formula we are assuming that there are no vertices of assuming that there are no vertices of assuming that there are no vertices of degree one we can we can argue that
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,16:44,16:51,degree one we can we can argue that degree one we can we can argue that summation f is two times the number of summation f is two times the number of summation f is two times the number of edges because if you have vertices with edges because if you have vertices with
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,16:51,17:01,edges because if you have vertices with degree the edge corresponding to that degree the edge corresponding to that degree the edge corresponding to that is part of only one phase so the two is part of only one phase so the two is part of only one phase so the two term does not come okay our objective is
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,17:01,17:15,term does not come okay our objective is term does not come okay our objective is to show that k is not planar in to show that k is not planar in to show that k is not planar in order to do this we will obtain a order to do this we will obtain a
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,17:15,17:39,order to do this we will obtain a corollary of the eulers planarity corollary of the eulers planarity corollary of the eulers planarity theorem now let g be any graph with so concept of a connected graph without so concept of a connected graph without any vertices of degree one okay so this
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,17:39,17:45,any vertices of degree one okay so this any vertices of degree one okay so this would mean that every vertex is part of would mean that every vertex is part of would mean that every vertex is part of some particular cycle okay now if we some particular cycle okay now if we
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,17:45,17:52,some particular cycle okay now if we further assume that this is a planar further assume that this is a planar further assume that this is a planar graph it is an embedding okay so graph it is an embedding okay so graph it is an embedding okay so consider a particular embedding on the
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,17:52,18:06,consider a particular embedding on the consider a particular embedding on the graph and if you look at the faces if we graph and if you look at the faces if we graph and if you look at the faces if we denote them by f f f f and and so on
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,18:06,18:15,denote them by f f f f and and so on denote them by f f f f and and so on we can associate with each phase its we can associate with each phase its we can associate with each phase its boundary edges for example these red boundary edges for example these red
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,18:15,18:42,boundary edges for example these red edges are the boundary edges of the face edges are the boundary edges of the face edges are the boundary edges of the face f now let small fi denote the number of f now let small fi denote the number of f now let small fi denote the number of boundary edges for the face if i so note
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,18:42,18:49,boundary edges for the face if i so note boundary edges for the face if i so note that every edge is part of precisely two that every edge is part of precisely two that every edge is part of precisely two faces for example if you look at this
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,18:49,18:57,faces for example if you look at this faces for example if you look at this blue edge that is a boundary edge of f blue edge that is a boundary edge of f blue edge that is a boundary edge of f f okay and therefore we can conclude
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,18:57,19:06,f okay and therefore we can conclude f okay and therefore we can conclude that summation fi over all the faces that summation fi over all the faces that summation fi over all the faces that is going to be equal to twice the that is going to be equal to twice the
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,19:06,19:18,that is going to be equal to twice the number of edges because each boundary number of edges because each boundary number of edges because each boundary edge is being counted twice once for edge is being counted twice once for edge is being counted twice once for each of the phase that it belongs to so
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,19:18,19:25,each of the phase that it belongs to so each of the phase that it belongs to so now if you take a simple connected graph now if you take a simple connected graph now if you take a simple connected graph we can argue that every phase will have
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,19:25,19:46,we can argue that every phase will have we can argue that every phase will have at least three boundary edges three boundary edges then efi is greater three boundary edges then efi is greater than or equal to three therefore if f than or equal to three therefore if f
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,19:46,19:54,than or equal to three therefore if f was the total number of faces three f is was the total number of faces three f is was the total number of faces three f is going to be definitely so summation f i going to be definitely so summation f i
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,19:54,20:06,going to be definitely so summation f i is at least three f this is equal to e is at least three f this is equal to e is at least three f this is equal to e so we can conclude that f is less than so we can conclude that f is less than
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,20:06,20:17,so we can conclude that f is less than e by okay now if we substitute this in e by okay now if we substitute this in e by okay now if we substitute this in the eulers formula v minus e plus f is the eulers formula v minus e plus f is
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,20:17,20:25,the eulers formula v minus e plus f is equal to what we get is e is equal to equal to what we get is e is equal to equal to what we get is e is equal to v plus f minus and thats going to be v plus f minus and thats going to be
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,20:25,20:40,v plus f minus and thats going to be less than v plus e by minus less than v plus e by minus less than v plus e by minus therefore e is less than week so therefore e is less than week so therefore e is less than week so this is a corollary that we can use and
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,20:40,20:47,this is a corollary that we can use and this is a corollary that we can use and if we assume that graph doesnt have any if we assume that graph doesnt have any if we assume that graph doesnt have any cycles of length greater than length cycles of length greater than length
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,20:47,21:03,cycles of length greater than length less than so then we can conclude that less than so then we can conclude that less than so then we can conclude that every phase is at least four boundary every phase is at least four boundary every phase is at least four boundary edges so if the graph is triangle free
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,21:03,21:18,then what we have is every face must then what we have is every face must contain at least four edges so for f contain at least four edges so for f contain at least four edges so for f will be less than summation fi over all will be less than summation fi over all
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,21:18,21:25,will be less than summation fi over all the phases and this is equal to e so f the phases and this is equal to e so f the phases and this is equal to e so f is less than e by and in that case if is less than e by and in that case if
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,21:25,21:30,is less than e by and in that case if we substitute in the formula is equal to we substitute in the formula is equal to we substitute in the formula is equal to v plus f minus we will get e is less v plus f minus we will get e is less
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,21:30,21:38,v plus f minus we will get e is less than or equal to v e by minus so than or equal to v e by minus so than or equal to v e by minus so there we can conclude that e is going to there we can conclude that e is going to
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,21:38,21:46,there we can conclude that e is going to be less than v minus so these are be less than v minus so these are be less than v minus so these are the two things that we can use in order the two things that we can use in order
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,21:46,21:55,the two things that we can use in order to show that various graphs are non to show that various graphs are non to show that various graphs are non planar planar planar so lets do that so the first thing we so lets do that so the first thing we
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,21:55,22:13,so lets do that so the first thing we will show is k is non planar so this will show is k is non planar so this will show is k is non planar so this is six vertices and nine edges okay if is six vertices and nine edges okay if
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,22:13,22:25,is six vertices and nine edges okay if we substitute in e is less than v we substitute in e is less than v we substitute in e is less than v minus e is equal to and should be minus e is equal to and should be minus e is equal to and should be less than or equal to times v that is
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,22:25,22:34,less than or equal to times v that is less than or equal to times v that is into minus thats equal to so into minus thats equal to so into minus thats equal to so must be less than k was planar it must be less than k was planar it
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,22:34,22:42,must be less than k was planar it must satisfy this particular relation must satisfy this particular relation must satisfy this particular relation because k is a bipartite graph it is because k is a bipartite graph it is because k is a bipartite graph it is triangle free and therefore this
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,22:42,22:51,triangle free and therefore this triangle free and therefore this condition applies and if it applies the condition applies and if it applies the condition applies and if it applies the should be less than and thats not should be less than and thats not should be less than and thats not the case so we have our contradiction if
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,22:51,22:58,the case so we have our contradiction if the case so we have our contradiction if we look at k thats another graph that we look at k thats another graph that we look at k thats another graph that we can show to be non planar we showed we can show to be non planar we showed
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,22:58,23:06,we can show to be non planar we showed that particular graph obtained by that particular graph obtained by that particular graph obtained by removing this one edge from k was removing this one edge from k was removing this one edge from k was planar but if we include that edge into
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,23:06,23:28,planar but if we include that edge into planar but if we include that edge into it we have k and k we will show as a it we have k and k we will show as a it we have k and k we will show as a non planar graph
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,23:28,23:42,okay again its simple application of okay again its simple application of this particular corollary number of this particular corollary number of this particular corollary number of edges in k is because there were two edges in k is because there were two edges in k is because there were two pentagons and should be less than
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,23:42,23:52,pentagons and should be less than pentagons and should be less than times the number of vertices the number times the number of vertices the number times the number of vertices the number of vertices was minus so this is of vertices was minus so this is of vertices was minus so this is minus the should be less than
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,23:52,23:59,minus the should be less than minus the should be less than if k were planar so that is a proof of if k were planar so that is a proof of if k were planar so that is a proof of nonlinearity of k look at a slightly nonlinearity of k look at a slightly
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,23:59,24:15,nonlinearity of k look at a slightly more complicated example but essentially more complicated example but essentially more complicated example but essentially the same principle if we look at our the same principle if we look at our the same principle if we look at our peterson graph this is a graph with
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,24:15,24:26,peterson graph this is a graph with peterson graph this is a graph with vertices so v is and number of edges vertices so v is and number of edges vertices so v is and number of edges is okay and we can show that this i is okay and we can show that this i
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,24:26,24:34,is okay and we can show that this i mean this is certainly not a bipartite mean this is certainly not a bipartite mean this is certainly not a bipartite graph because it is an odd cycle so the graph because it is an odd cycle so the graph because it is an odd cycle so the only condition that we can hope to apply
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,24:34,24:45,only condition that we can hope to apply only condition that we can hope to apply from the car all the two corollary said from the car all the two corollary said from the car all the two corollary said we had drawn us e is less than v minus
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,24:45,24:56,we had drawn us e is less than v minus we had drawn us e is less than v minus but that condition unfortunately it but that condition unfortunately it but that condition unfortunately it doesnt lead to a contradiction because doesnt lead to a contradiction because doesnt lead to a contradiction because e is and v is minus so the
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,24:56,25:04,e is and v is minus so the e is and v is minus so the condition holds but the condition holds condition holds but the condition holds condition holds but the condition holds doesnt necessarily mean that the graph doesnt necessarily mean that the graph doesnt necessarily mean that the graph is planar but here what we can do is we
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,25:04,25:10,is planar but here what we can do is we is planar but here what we can do is we can look at the original condition that can look at the original condition that can look at the original condition that says summation f over all phases is says summation f over all phases is
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,25:10,25:26,says summation f over all phases is equal to e so here i mean there are no equal to e so here i mean there are no equal to e so here i mean there are no cycles or cycles cycles or cycles cycles or cycles ok so if you so peter zenger graph
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,25:26,25:43,doesnt have three cycles or four cycles doesnt have three cycles or four cycles theres something that you can easily theres something that you can easily theres something that you can easily check and because of this every face check and because of this every face check and because of this every face must contain at least five edges so five
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,25:43,25:50,must contain at least five edges so five must contain at least five edges so five times f is going to be less than times f is going to be less than times f is going to be less than summation fi thats equal to e so we summation fi thats equal to e so we
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,25:50,25:57,summation fi thats equal to e so we can conclude from this that f is less can conclude from this that f is less can conclude from this that f is less than e by now if we look at e is than e by now if we look at e is
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,25:57,26:06,than e by now if we look at e is equal to v plus f minus we can equal to v plus f minus we can equal to v plus f minus we can conclude that you should be less than conclude that you should be less than conclude that you should be less than and if it were planar then e must be
214.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,26:06,26:12,and if it were planar then e must be and if it were planar then e must be equal to v plus f minus and these equal to v plus f minus and these equal to v plus f minus and these should be less than or equal to v plus

215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,2:10,2:18,to as breadthfirst search you can also look at north tonight approach you find look at north tonight approach you find look at north tonight approach you find one of your friends look at another one of your friends look at another one of your friends look at another friend of hers and keep on doing that
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,2:18,2:23,friend of hers and keep on doing that friend of hers and keep on doing that sequence of friends then you will get sequence of friends then you will get sequence of friends then you will get what is called as dfs okay the commonly what is called as dfs okay the commonly
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,2:23,2:41,what is called as dfs okay the commonly used searching techniques there well used searching techniques there well used searching techniques there well just write them down breadthfirst just write them down breadthfirst just write them down breadthfirst search and depthfirst search so here if you stand your search at
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,2:41,2:54,so here if you stand your search at vertex one we may view vertices a two vertex one we may view vertices a two vertex one we may view vertices a two and four are the vertices at depth and and four are the vertices at depth and and four are the vertices at depth and the vertex is at depth so if you
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,2:54,3:06,the vertex is at depth so if you the vertex is at depth so if you look at the order followed by look at the order followed by look at the order followed by forward by that would be the forward by that would be the forward by that would be the breadthfirst search you have listed
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,3:06,3:19,breadthfirst search you have listed breadthfirst search you have listed them in the order of their depth that is them in the order of their depth that is them in the order of their depth that is called as a breadthfirst search whereas called as a breadthfirst search whereas called as a breadthfirst search whereas if you list it as so youve gone
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,3:19,3:27,if you list it as so youve gone if you list it as so youve gone from to from you could go to from to from you could go to from to from you could go to from you could go to okay but there from you could go to okay but there
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,3:27,3:41,from you could go to okay but there are examples where these two searches are examples where these two searches are examples where these two searches return different orderings ok so lets return different orderings ok so lets return different orderings ok so lets look at this more formally lets just
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,3:41,3:50,look at this more formally lets just look at this more formally lets just look at it look at a little more look at it look at a little more look at it look at a little more complicated example so we have the complicated example so we have the
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,3:50,4:13,complicated example so we have the following graph suppose we have this graph what will be suppose we have this graph what will be what will the bfs ordering be and what what will the bfs ordering be and what what will the bfs ordering be and what will the depthfirst search
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,4:13,4:26,will the depthfirst search will the depthfirst search ordering we will first write down the ordering we will first write down the ordering we will first write down the bfs ordering starting at vertex so the bfs ordering starting at vertex so the bfs ordering starting at vertex so the start vertex let us color reduce in red
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,4:26,4:31,start vertex let us color reduce in red start vertex let us color reduce in red this is just to indicate that it is a this is just to indicate that it is a this is just to indicate that it is a starting vertex so that will be the
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,4:31,4:38,starting vertex so that will be the starting vertex so that will be the first vertex that is encountered in bfs first vertex that is encountered in bfs first vertex that is encountered in bfs or in dfs and now look at all the or in dfs and now look at all the
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,4:38,4:50,or in dfs and now look at all the neighbors of one that precisely neighbors of one that precisely neighbors of one that precisely neighbors amp lists them out you will neighbors amp lists them out you will neighbors amp lists them out you will get amp and the next stage would be to
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,4:50,4:56,get amp and the next stage would be to get amp and the next stage would be to list out all the neighbors of followed list out all the neighbors of followed list out all the neighbors of followed by all the neighbors of to do that in by all the neighbors of to do that in
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,4:56,5:03,by all the neighbors of to do that in this case the neighbors of that is this case the neighbors of that is this case the neighbors of that is so we will not list out the already so we will not list out the already so we will not list out the already listed neighbors so there are precisely
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,5:03,5:23,listed neighbors so there are precisely listed neighbors so there are precisely neighbors namely amp so is a neighbors namely amp so is a neighbors namely amp so is a neighbor of as well as is a neighbor of as well as is a neighbor of as well as is a neighbor only of and not of and then
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,5:23,5:31,neighbor only of and not of and then neighbor only of and not of and then we will list out neighbors of amp they we will list out neighbors of amp they we will list out neighbors of amp they will get and then we have the will get and then we have the
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,5:31,5:45,will get and then we have the neighbor okay so this would be the dfs neighbor okay so this would be the dfs neighbor okay so this would be the dfs ordering that s if you take the dfs ordering that s if you take the dfs ordering that s if you take the dfs outdrink so lets say so in bfs art
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,5:45,5:51,outdrink so lets say so in bfs art outdrink so lets say so in bfs art drink its not a mean its not fully drink its not a mean its not fully drink its not a mean its not fully determined in the sense the did be determined in the sense the did be
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,5:51,5:59,determined in the sense the did be vertex visit vertex before or vertex visit vertex before or vertex visit vertex before or louisville visit before that is not louisville visit before that is not louisville visit before that is not really specified you could visit in any really specified you could visit in any
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,5:59,6:10,really specified you could visit in any order and that has a chain of other order and that has a chain of other order and that has a chain of other choices that may not be fully determined choices that may not be fully determined choices that may not be fully determined okay the same applies in dfs which
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,6:10,6:17,okay the same applies in dfs which okay the same applies in dfs which neighbor you pick neighbor you pick neighbor you pick there is no restrictions in either bfs there is no restrictions in either bfs there is no restrictions in either bfs or dfs but whether or dfs but whether
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,6:17,6:28,or dfs but whether you look at all neighbors of a node and you look at all neighbors of a node and you look at all neighbors of a node and then go to the next level or whether you then go to the next level or whether you then go to the next level or whether you keep on traversing the graph layer by
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,6:28,6:33,keep on traversing the graph layer by keep on traversing the graph layer by layer from one vertex to its neighbor layer from one vertex to its neighbor layer from one vertex to its neighbor and then to its neighbor and so on so and then to its neighbor and so on so
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,6:33,6:44,and then to its neighbor and so on so that is what differentiates bfs and dfs that is what differentiates bfs and dfs that is what differentiates bfs and dfs okay so dfs our drink from so you could okay so dfs our drink from so you could okay so dfs our drink from so you could go from vertex one to vertex lets say
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,6:44,6:54,go from vertex one to vertex lets say go from vertex one to vertex lets say three and from three you could go to three and from three you could go to three and from three you could go to four from four you could go either to four from four you could go either to
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,6:54,7:00,four from four you could go either to five or six so the ones which we are five or six so the ones which we are five or six so the ones which we are visited will just draw in red so one two visited will just draw in red so one two
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,7:00,7:12,visited will just draw in red so one two three we went from three to four we went three we went from three to four we went three we went from three to four we went and then four to six we could go and and then four to six we could go and
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,7:12,7:23,and then four to six we could go and from six we could go to eight and from from six we could go to eight and from from six we could go to eight and from eight we could go to seven and from eight we could go to seven and from
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,7:23,7:47,eight we could go to seven and from seven we could go to five and after we have reached five we see and after we have reached five we see that all its neighbors are essentially that all its neighbors are essentially that all its neighbors are essentially visited okay so the neighbors are five
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,7:47,7:51,visited okay so the neighbors are five visited okay so the neighbors are five or three four and six all of them i or three four and six all of them i or three four and six all of them i visited so you go back to the node from
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,7:51,7:56,visited so you go back to the node from visited so you go back to the node from where you came to five namely seven its where you came to five namely seven its where you came to five namely seven its neighbors are all being taken care of neighbors are all being taken care of
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,7:56,8:03,neighbors are all being taken care of same with eight same with six same with same with eight same with six same with same with eight same with six same with four you backtrack all the way up to four you backtrack all the way up to four you backtrack all the way up to vertex four four has a neighbor which is
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,8:03,8:08,vertex four four has a neighbor which is vertex four four has a neighbor which is not yet visited so that is node number not yet visited so that is node number not yet visited so that is node number two so that will be the last node that two so that will be the last node that
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,8:08,8:17,two so that will be the last node that is visited okay so this will be the dfs is visited okay so this will be the dfs is visited okay so this will be the dfs ordering now we will see how we can ordering now we will see how we can
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,8:17,8:29,ordering now we will see how we can algorithm italy implement this well see algorithm italy implement this well see algorithm italy implement this well see an algorithm for we are doing these an algorithm for we are doing these an algorithm for we are doing these searches what we will do is the
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,8:29,8:43,searches what we will do is the searches what we will do is the following we will have colors associated with we will have colors associated with every vortex these colors is to indicate every vortex these colors is to indicate every vortex these colors is to indicate whether certain vertex has been visited
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,8:43,8:55,whether certain vertex has been visited whether certain vertex has been visited whether all its neighbors have been whether all its neighbors have been whether all its neighbors have been explored and so on so we will have three explored and so on so we will have three explored and so on so we will have three colors so colors will be one attribute
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,8:55,9:04,colors so colors will be one attribute colors so colors will be one attribute another attribute would be its another attribute would be its another attribute would be its predecessor the each vertex will have a predecessor the each vertex will have a predecessor the each vertex will have a predecessor so this will indicate the
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,9:04,9:13,predecessor so this will indicate the predecessor so this will indicate the vertex from which we explored the given vertex from which we explored the given vertex from which we explored the given vertex so if you have a vertex u so u vertex so if you have a vertex u so u
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,9:13,9:22,vertex so if you have a vertex u so u dot color will initially be white for dot color will initially be white for dot color will initially be white for every vertex so this is the start state every vertex so this is the start state every vertex so this is the start state if every vertex will be initially white
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,9:22,9:33,if every vertex will be initially white if every vertex will be initially white the other colors are gray and black gray the other colors are gray and black gray the other colors are gray and black gray would mean we have partially explored would mean we have partially explored
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,9:33,9:39,would mean we have partially explored that vertex and it is still under that vertex and it is still under that vertex and it is still under process some of its neighbors have been process some of its neighbors have been process some of its neighbors have been explored some of them have not been
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,9:39,9:48,explored some of them have not been explored some of them have not been black basically means all its that black basically means all its that black basically means all its that vertex everything that we have to do vertex everything that we have to do vertex everything that we have to do with respect to that vertex is over we
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,9:48,9:52,with respect to that vertex is over we with respect to that vertex is over we have we have finished the processing of have we have finished the processing of have we have finished the processing of that particular vertex and there will be that particular vertex and there will be
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,9:52,10:04,that particular vertex and there will be another parameter associated with each another parameter associated with each another parameter associated with each vertex that will be its predecessor so vertex that will be its predecessor so vertex that will be its predecessor so we will denote it by u dot phi so u dot
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,10:04,10:13,we will denote it by u dot phi so u dot we will denote it by u dot phi so u dot v would mean the predecessor of u and v would mean the predecessor of u and v would mean the predecessor of u and this is the vertex from which
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,10:13,10:31,we reached vertex u so that will be the we reached vertex u so that will be the predecessor of u now our algorithm the predecessor of u now our algorithm the predecessor of u now our algorithm the way it works is it will have a queue and way it works is it will have a queue and
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,10:31,10:40,way it works is it will have a queue and we will push these vertices into a queue we will push these vertices into a queue we will push these vertices into a queue as the algorithm progresses and after as the algorithm progresses and after as the algorithm progresses and after the process all processing the scan is
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,10:40,10:49,the process all processing the scan is the process all processing the scan is done would have visited all the vertices done would have visited all the vertices done would have visited all the vertices from a given starting starting vertex we from a given starting starting vertex we from a given starting starting vertex we will assume that the initial graph that
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,10:49,10:56,will assume that the initial graph that will assume that the initial graph that is given to us is an undirected graph is given to us is an undirected graph is given to us is an undirected graph which is a connected graph of course bfs which is a connected graph of course bfs
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,10:56,11:03,which is a connected graph of course bfs would work even if the graph was a would work even if the graph was a would work even if the graph was a directed graph and if it was a directed graph and if it was a directed graph and if it was a disconnected graph as well when the
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,11:03,11:10,disconnected graph as well when the disconnected graph as well when the graph is disconnected what we can do is graph is disconnected what we can do is graph is disconnected what we can do is we can start a bfs at some arbitrary we can start a bfs at some arbitrary
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,11:10,11:19,we can start a bfs at some arbitrary node in each connected component we node in each connected component we node in each connected component we might need to discover what are the might need to discover what are the might need to discover what are the connected components or we could just
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,11:19,11:25,connected components or we could just connected components or we could just start bfs at every vertex of the graph start bfs at every vertex of the graph start bfs at every vertex of the graph they start over this bfs at every vertex they start over this bfs at every vertex
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,11:25,11:35,they start over this bfs at every vertex of graph we need to check whether a of graph we need to check whether a of graph we need to check whether a certain vertex has already been covered certain vertex has already been covered certain vertex has already been covered by any other previous bfs so while doing
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,11:35,11:43,by any other previous bfs so while doing by any other previous bfs so while doing the breadthfirst search if we have the breadthfirst search if we have the breadthfirst search if we have already seen some vertex as part of already seen some vertex as part of already seen some vertex as part of searching certain other component we can
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,11:43,11:52,searching certain other component we can searching certain other component we can ignore that bfs search so that ignore that bfs search so that ignore that bfs search so that modification can be made and directed modification can be made and directed modification can be made and directed graphs the essentially the same
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,11:52,12:01,graphs the essentially the same graphs the essentially the same algorithm would work but for simple if algorithm would work but for simple if algorithm would work but for simple if we simply just to keep keep things we simply just to keep keep things we simply just to keep keep things simple we will just look at a undirected
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,12:01,12:13,simple we will just look at a undirected simple we will just look at a undirected example okay so in the bfs algorithm we example okay so in the bfs algorithm we example okay so in the bfs algorithm we have to initialize the colors so theres have to initialize the colors so theres
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,12:13,12:27,have to initialize the colors so theres an initialization phase where in for an initialization phase where in for an initialization phase where in for every vertex so u dot color will be set every vertex so u dot color will be set every vertex so u dot color will be set to white that means and the start
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,12:27,12:43,to white that means and the start to white that means and the start these are all unexplored so we will these are all unexplored so we will these are all unexplored so we will assume that the bfs algorithm which assume that the bfs algorithm which assume that the bfs algorithm which means we may call it as bfs it has two
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,12:43,12:51,means we may call it as bfs it has two means we may call it as bfs it has two parameters the given graph and the parameters the given graph and the parameters the given graph and the starting vertex s and for every vertex starting vertex s and for every vertex
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,12:51,12:57,starting vertex s and for every vertex the parent u dot pi will be equal to nil the parent u dot pi will be equal to nil the parent u dot pi will be equal to nil so initially we do not know what is the so initially we do not know what is the
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,12:57,13:05,so initially we do not know what is the predecessor or parent of a particular predecessor or parent of a particular predecessor or parent of a particular vertex so we will just set it to pi as vertex so we will just set it to pi as vertex so we will just set it to pi as our algorithm progresses when a node is
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,13:05,13:14,our algorithm progresses when a node is our algorithm progresses when a node is discovered for the very first time the discovered for the very first time the discovered for the very first time the node the edge which caused the discovery node the edge which caused the discovery node the edge which caused the discovery of this particular node will be explored
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,13:14,13:21,of this particular node will be explored of this particular node will be explored and that edge will tell us what is the and that edge will tell us what is the and that edge will tell us what is the predecessor of the particular node that predecessor of the particular node that
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,13:21,13:33,predecessor of the particular node that we have just now found so initially this we have just now found so initially this we have just now found so initially this is set to nil and then we can also is set to nil and then we can also is set to nil and then we can also initialize the queue we will call it as
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,13:33,13:41,initialize the queue we will call it as initialize the queue we will call it as a the queue we will name it as queue a the queue we will name it as queue a the queue we will name it as queue itself and this is set to empty ok so
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,13:41,13:56,itself and this is set to empty ok so itself and this is set to empty ok so there is an empty queue the queue queue there is an empty queue the queue queue there is an empty queue the queue queue will be used to track the vertices and
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,13:56,14:05,will be used to track the vertices and will be used to track the vertices and as it is initialized to empty and then as it is initialized to empty and then as it is initialized to empty and then what the algorithm does is it will what the algorithm does is it will
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,14:05,14:21,what the algorithm does is it will repeatedly explore for whatever is there repeatedly explore for whatever is there repeatedly explore for whatever is there in the queue so after the queue has been initialized so after the queue has been initialized we have to add one element so we will
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,14:21,14:31,we have to add one element so we will we have to add one element so we will add s to queue the starting element that add s to queue the starting element that add s to queue the starting element that we had the the starting vertex thats we had the the starting vertex thats
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,14:31,14:48,we had the the starting vertex thats added to the queue will be the first added to the queue will be the first added to the queue will be the first step of the algorithm and then while step of the algorithm and then while step of the algorithm and then while queue is nonempty we will repeatedly do
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,14:48,15:05,queue is nonempty we will repeatedly do queue is nonempty we will repeatedly do certain actions so delete an element certain actions so delete an element certain actions so delete an element from the queue so we will call this from the queue so we will call this from the queue so we will call this deleted element as v from q so q is a
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,15:05,15:10,deleted element as v from q so q is a deleted element as v from q so q is a first in first out data structure which first in first out data structure which first in first out data structure which means the element that youve added they means the element that youve added they
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,15:10,15:15,means the element that youve added they will be removed in the same order so at will be removed in the same order so at will be removed in the same order so at the start we have added just one element the start we have added just one element
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,15:15,15:26,the start we have added just one element so when you try to delete the first so when you try to delete the first so when you try to delete the first element that will be deleted it is going element that will be deleted it is going element that will be deleted it is going to be s and then for every neighbor of v
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,15:26,15:30,to be s and then for every neighbor of v to be s and then for every neighbor of v so we have deleted one particular so we have deleted one particular so we have deleted one particular element for each of its neighbors we element for each of its neighbors we
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,15:30,15:54,element for each of its neighbors we would we would start exploring those would we would start exploring those would we would start exploring those vertices so for every neighbor lets say vertices so for every neighbor lets say vertices so for every neighbor lets say you of v we will do the following so we
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,15:54,16:00,you of v we will do the following so we you of v we will do the following so we have one particular node that is deleted have one particular node that is deleted have one particular node that is deleted and that might have many neighbors and and that might have many neighbors and
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,16:00,16:09,and that might have many neighbors and for each of the neighbor if it is a none for each of the neighbor if it is a none for each of the neighbor if it is a none explode neighbor means no means this explode neighbor means no means this explode neighbor means no means this vertex vertex has not been explored
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,16:09,16:20,vertex vertex has not been explored vertex vertex has not been explored before we would want to do something before we would want to do something before we would want to do something with it if it has already been explored with it if it has already been explored with it if it has already been explored we will just leave it as it is so if you
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,16:20,16:28,we will just leave it as it is so if you we will just leave it as it is so if you dot color is equal to white dot color is equal to white dot color is equal to white music music music in that case what we will have to do is
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,16:28,16:34,in that case what we will have to do is in that case what we will have to do is we will have to push this into the queue we will have to push this into the queue we will have to push this into the queue and before adding it into the queue we
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,16:34,16:39,and before adding it into the queue we and before adding it into the queue we will change its color so this means we will change its color so this means we will change its color so this means we need to process it so we will change its need to process it so we will change its
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,16:39,16:45,need to process it so we will change its color and it is the processing has begun color and it is the processing has begun color and it is the processing has begun you wrote color is equal to gray and its you wrote color is equal to gray and its
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,16:45,16:55,you wrote color is equal to gray and its parent you dot predecessor this we will parent you dot predecessor this we will parent you dot predecessor this we will set it to v because v was the vertex set it to v because v was the vertex set it to v because v was the vertex from which we visited u because u is a
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,16:55,17:01,from which we visited u because u is a from which we visited u because u is a neighbor of v okay so the parent is neighbor of v okay so the parent is neighbor of v okay so the parent is being set and then we can add you to the
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,17:01,17:13,being set and then we can add you to the being set and then we can add you to the queue add you to queue and after this queue add you to queue and after this queue add you to queue and after this processing is done for every neighbor we
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,17:13,17:23,processing is done for every neighbor we processing is done for every neighbor we can change the color of the vertex v to can change the color of the vertex v to can change the color of the vertex v to black because v has been processed so v black because v has been processed so v
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,17:23,17:37,black because v has been processed so v dot color is equal to black okay so dot color is equal to black okay so dot color is equal to black okay so thats the algorithm so now lets see thats the algorithm so now lets see thats the algorithm so now lets see this in action so lets say we have this
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,17:37,18:11,this in action so lets say we have this this in action so lets say we have this following graph if you start at vertex one so this we if you start at vertex one so this we will maintain a queue so theres our will maintain a queue so theres our
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,18:11,18:24,will maintain a queue so theres our initial queue and we will first add initial queue and we will first add initial queue and we will first add vertex one to the queue thats the only vertex one to the queue thats the only vertex one to the queue thats the only element that is there in the queue and
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,18:24,18:34,element that is there in the queue and element that is there in the queue and then we delete one so initially the then we delete one so initially the then we delete one so initially the color of all vertices are essentially color of all vertices are essentially color of all vertices are essentially white okay once we have added the color
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,18:34,18:41,white okay once we have added the color white okay once we have added the color of that vertex changes it becomes gray of that vertex changes it becomes gray of that vertex changes it becomes gray so one is now a gray vortex and we will so one is now a gray vortex and we will
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,18:41,18:48,so one is now a gray vortex and we will look at all the neighbors of you and look at all the neighbors of you and look at all the neighbors of you and change its color and we will set its change its color and we will set its
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,18:48,18:58,change its color and we will set its parent to one so the vertex one has two parent to one so the vertex one has two parent to one so the vertex one has two neighbors namely namely two and three neighbors namely namely two and three neighbors namely namely two and three okay so two and three their color is
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,18:58,19:09,okay so two and three their color is okay so two and three their color is being changed to gray and the parent is being changed to gray and the parent is being changed to gray and the parent is being set to vertex one so there is being set to vertex one so there is
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,19:09,19:20,being set to vertex one so there is going to be so by this arrow i will going to be so by this arrow i will going to be so by this arrow i will indicate the parent so twos name a indicate the parent so twos name a indicate the parent so twos name a parent is s parent is also what ok
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,19:20,19:23,parent is s parent is also what ok parent is s parent is also what ok and after this and so this is a step and after this and so this is a step and after this and so this is a step that you do and and has been added
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,19:23,19:28,that you do and and has been added that you do and and has been added so we may assume that first is added so we may assume that first is added so we may assume that first is added and after the processing has done is and after the processing has done is
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,19:28,19:43,and after the processing has done is added okay so vertex would be added added okay so vertex would be added added okay so vertex would be added and vertex would be added and we would and vertex would be added and we would and vertex would be added and we would have taken off one after this ok so that
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,19:43,19:47,have taken off one after this ok so that have taken off one after this ok so that would that would have been the first would that would have been the first would that would have been the first step we deleted that element and we have step we deleted that element and we have
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,19:47,20:00,step we deleted that element and we have changed the color of to black ok so changed the color of to black ok so changed the color of to black ok so now its no longer gray but it has now its no longer gray but it has now its no longer gray but it has become black indicating that full
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,20:00,20:13,become black indicating that full become black indicating that full processing is over the queue is still processing is over the queue is still processing is over the queue is still not empty so we will pick out vertex not empty so we will pick out vertex not empty so we will pick out vertex and if you look at vertex
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,20:13,20:32,that has been deleted once vertex has that has been deleted once vertex has been deleted we will look at all its been deleted we will look at all its been deleted we will look at all its neighbors vertex has namely three neighbors vertex has namely three neighbors vertex has namely three neighbors one three and five sorry one
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,20:32,20:40,neighbors one three and five sorry one neighbors one three and five sorry one five and six are the neighbors okay when five and six are the neighbors okay when five and six are the neighbors okay when you look at these neighbors five and six you look at these neighbors five and six
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,20:40,20:47,you look at these neighbors five and six both are currently of color white so we both are currently of color white so we both are currently of color white so we can add them okay so let us say we first can add them okay so let us say we first
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,20:47,20:59,can add them okay so let us say we first add five and then add six okay so that add five and then add six okay so that add five and then add six okay so that goes inside the cube and their color as goes inside the cube and their color as
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,20:59,21:10,goes inside the cube and their color as well as parent is reset so five becomes well as parent is reset so five becomes well as parent is reset so five becomes the first neighbor let us say its five the first neighbor let us say its five the first neighbor let us say its five okay so color is changed and the parent
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,21:10,21:23,okay so color is changed and the parent okay so color is changed and the parent is said two and five is added and after is said two and five is added and after is said two and five is added and after five was added the next neighbor of two
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,21:23,21:29,five was added the next neighbor of two five was added the next neighbor of two is going to be six thats also its been is going to be six thats also its been is going to be six thats also its been to change its color to gray and we have
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,21:29,21:39,to change its color to gray and we have to change its color to gray and we have a fair and for six which is two and six a fair and for six which is two and six a fair and for six which is two and six is being added into the queue okay so
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,21:39,21:44,is being added into the queue okay so is being added into the queue okay so after five and six has been added the after five and six has been added the after five and six has been added the next node that you process is three next node that you process is three
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,21:44,21:56,next node that you process is three three has again three neighbors one five three has again three neighbors one five three has again three neighbors one five and four out of them the only white and four out of them the only white and four out of them the only white neighbor is going to be four so that
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,21:56,22:13,neighbor is going to be four so that neighbor is going to be four so that will be converted into gray and the will be converted into gray and the will be converted into gray and the parent would be set to three and additionally we would have for and additionally we would have for coming into the queue and three by the
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,22:13,22:19,coming into the queue and three by the coming into the queue and three by the stage is done with repeated three the stage is done with repeated three the stage is done with repeated three the next element that is going to be deleted next element that is going to be deleted
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,22:19,22:27,next element that is going to be deleted is five but there is no further is five but there is no further is five but there is no further processing to be done with five because processing to be done with five because processing to be done with five because all the neighbors of five would have
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,22:27,22:35,all the neighbors of five would have all the neighbors of five would have been already of color other than white been already of color other than white been already of color other than white so five is also done so when we are so five is also done so when we are
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,22:35,22:43,so five is also done so when we are deleting and after the delete phase deleting and after the delete phase deleting and after the delete phase after the neighbors have been processed after the neighbors have been processed after the neighbors have been processed we would have changed the color to black
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,22:43,22:50,we would have changed the color to black we would have changed the color to black so there are weve skipped a couple of so there are weve skipped a couple of so there are weve skipped a couple of steps we would have changed to two black steps we would have changed to two black
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,22:50,23:08,steps we would have changed to two black and three to black after that and then and three to black after that and then and three to black after that and then five to black the next node that is going to be the next node that is going to be processed is going to be six six is one
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,23:08,23:13,processed is going to be six six is one processed is going to be six six is one neighbor namely seven so we will add neighbor namely seven so we will add neighbor namely seven so we will add seven into the mix into the queue and seven into the mix into the queue and
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,23:13,23:27,seven into the mix into the queue and its colors changed and the parent is its colors changed and the parent is its colors changed and the parent is also set six the other neighbors of six also set six the other neighbors of six also set six the other neighbors of six are five and two which surely cannot be
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,23:27,23:37,are five and two which surely cannot be are five and two which surely cannot be added and after seven has been added we added and after seven has been added we added and after seven has been added we can say that the processing of six is can say that the processing of six is
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,23:37,23:56,can say that the processing of six is over and its color becomes black the over and its color becomes black the over and its color becomes black the next node that will be processed is four next node that will be processed is four next node that will be processed is four four has two neighbors three and seven
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,23:56,24:05,four has two neighbors three and seven four has two neighbors three and seven but both of them have colors different but both of them have colors different but both of them have colors different from white and therefore theres nothing from white and therefore theres nothing from white and therefore theres nothing to be done with any of the neighbors of
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,24:05,24:14,to be done with any of the neighbors of to be done with any of the neighbors of color will be changed to black and color will be changed to black and color will be changed to black and then the queue contains only seven that then the queue contains only seven that
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,24:14,24:20,then the queue contains only seven that is removed all the neighbors of seven is removed all the neighbors of seven is removed all the neighbors of seven namely six and four has already been namely six and four has already been namely six and four has already been processed theyre black in color and
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,24:20,24:28,processed theyre black in color and processed theyre black in color and therefore nothing has to be done with therefore nothing has to be done with therefore nothing has to be done with seven other than change its color to seven other than change its color to seven other than change its color to black okay and at this stage the cues
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,24:28,24:35,black okay and at this stage the cues black okay and at this stage the cues again empty so that processing is over again empty so that processing is over again empty so that processing is over and we would have traversed all the and we would have traversed all the
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,24:35,24:48,and we would have traversed all the nodes by that okay note that if you look nodes by that okay note that if you look nodes by that okay note that if you look at just the predecessors of each node at just the predecessors of each node at just the predecessors of each node that will be an interesting diagram this
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,24:48,24:58,that will be an interesting diagram this that will be an interesting diagram this will be a tree with no cycles its a will be a tree with no cycles its a will be a tree with no cycles its a directed tree with every node having a directed tree with every node having a
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,24:58,25:10,directed tree with every node having a unique path to the vertex one and so unique path to the vertex one and so unique path to the vertex one and so that tree is called as the bfs tree and that tree is called as the bfs tree and that tree is called as the bfs tree and this entire algorithm can be implemented
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,25:10,25:20,this entire algorithm can be implemented this entire algorithm can be implemented in linear time if you maintain the in linear time if you maintain the in linear time if you maintain the initial graph as an adjacency list initial graph as an adjacency list initial graph as an adjacency list the next search algorithm that we will
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,25:20,25:31,the next search algorithm that we will the next search algorithm that we will see is the bfs search so lets begin the see is the bfs search so lets begin the see is the bfs search so lets begin the dfs search the depthfirst search so dfs search the depthfirst search so
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,25:31,25:47,dfs search the depthfirst search so again we will have two parameters again we will have two parameters again we will have two parameters associated with each node namely its associated with each node namely its associated with each node namely its color and the parent instead of using a
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,25:47,25:55,color and the parent instead of using a color and the parent instead of using a q we could implement dfs algorithm using q we could implement dfs algorithm using q we could implement dfs algorithm using a stack we will see a recursive version a stack we will see a recursive version
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,25:55,26:01,a stack we will see a recursive version of the dfs algorithm where and we will of the dfs algorithm where and we will of the dfs algorithm where and we will not have to explicitly maintain the not have to explicitly maintain the not have to explicitly maintain the stack that a recursion would essentially
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,26:01,26:11,stack that a recursion would essentially stack that a recursion would essentially keep track of this stack so dfs keep track of this stack so dfs keep track of this stack so dfs algorithm this will require two inputs algorithm this will require two inputs algorithm this will require two inputs two parameters one is the graph itself
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,26:11,26:28,two parameters one is the graph itself two parameters one is the graph itself and the other is the starting vertex we and the other is the starting vertex we and the other is the starting vertex we will have an initialization phase were in the color of each vertex so u
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,26:28,26:46,were in the color of each vertex so u dot color is equal to white and u dot dot color is equal to white and u dot dot color is equal to white and u dot parent is equal to nil so before you parent is equal to nil so before you
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,26:46,26:54,parent is equal to nil so before you start the dfs algorithm on any start the dfs algorithm on any start the dfs algorithm on any particular graph we need to do this particular graph we need to do this particular graph we need to do this initialization ok and once this is
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,26:54,27:03,initialization ok and once this is initialization ok and once this is initialized we can call our dfs routine initialized we can call our dfs routine initialized we can call our dfs routine so write down the dfs routine two so write down the dfs routine two so write down the dfs routine two parameters g and s we will assume that
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,27:03,27:10,parameters g and s we will assume that parameters g and s we will assume that the initialization has already been done the initialization has already been done the initialization has already been done and what we will do is the following so and what we will do is the following so
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,27:10,27:21,and what we will do is the following so we will make the color of s to be gray we will make the color of s to be gray we will make the color of s to be gray so s dot color is equal to gray and then so s dot color is equal to gray and then
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,27:21,27:45,so s dot color is equal to gray and then for every neighbor of s reach we will do the following if vdot color we will do the following if vdot color is equal to white so while the dfs is is equal to white so while the dfs is
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,27:45,27:55,is equal to white so while the dfs is being run each vertex its color could being run each vertex its color could being run each vertex its color could change we want to ensure that the colors change we want to ensure that the colors change we want to ensure that the colors change from white to gray to black so if
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,27:55,28:00,change from white to gray to black so if change from white to gray to black so if you have a white colored vertex that you have a white colored vertex that you have a white colored vertex that means it is not being explored yet and means it is not being explored yet and
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,28:00,28:11,means it is not being explored yet and therefore we are ready to explore it now therefore we are ready to explore it now therefore we are ready to explore it now because its a neighbor of vertex s and because its a neighbor of vertex s and because its a neighbor of vertex s and what we will do is well just call dfs
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,28:11,28:23,what we will do is well just call dfs what we will do is well just call dfs with this new vertex on the same graph with this new vertex on the same graph with this new vertex on the same graph so dfs g v and after all the vertices of
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,28:23,28:31,so dfs g v and after all the vertices of so dfs g v and after all the vertices of s has been processed we can set the s has been processed we can set the s has been processed we can set the color of s to black s dot color is equal
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,28:31,28:40,color of s to black s dot color is equal color of s to black s dot color is equal to black maybes at this point just to black maybes at this point just to black maybes at this point just before calling the fs we will need to before calling the fs we will need to
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,28:40,29:16,before calling the fs we will need to set the parent v dot pi is equal to s set the parent v dot pi is equal to s set the parent v dot pi is equal to s okay so let us see how this works okay so suppose we have this particular
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,29:16,29:27,okay so suppose we have this particular graph and we start dfs at one okay so graph and we start dfs at one okay so graph and we start dfs at one okay so initially every vertex is of color of initially every vertex is of color of initially every vertex is of color of white and the parents that there are no
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,29:27,29:34,white and the parents that there are no white and the parents that there are no parents everything is nil okay and when parents everything is nil okay and when parents everything is nil okay and when you call dfs on vertex one what happens you call dfs on vertex one what happens
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,29:34,29:44,you call dfs on vertex one what happens is the color of that vertex immediately is the color of that vertex immediately is the color of that vertex immediately changes to gray and then what happens is changes to gray and then what happens is changes to gray and then what happens is the recursive calls start so for every
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,29:44,29:51,the recursive calls start so for every the recursive calls start so for every neighbor the vertex one has two neighbor the vertex one has two neighbor the vertex one has two neighbors namely two and three for each neighbors namely two and three for each neighbors namely two and three for each of them we are going to call the dfs let
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,29:51,29:55,of them we are going to call the dfs let of them we are going to call the dfs let us assume that the first dfs call will us assume that the first dfs call will us assume that the first dfs call will be and the next day of us call will
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,29:55,29:59,be and the next day of us call will be and the next day of us call will be but before that we need to check be but before that we need to check be but before that we need to check whether those are white indeed they are whether those are white indeed they are
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,29:59,30:05,whether those are white indeed they are white and therefore we can make those white and therefore we can make those white and therefore we can make those calls okay calls okay calls okay the very first call that will be for us the very first call that will be for us
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,30:05,30:22,the very first call that will be for us dfs when dfs is being called what dfs when dfs is being called what dfs when dfs is being called what happens is it will go into the recursive happens is it will go into the recursive happens is it will go into the recursive call the recursive routine and inside
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,30:22,30:33,call the recursive routine and inside call the recursive routine and inside that the color of this would be made that the color of this would be made that the color of this would be made great and we would have set the parent great and we would have set the parent
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,30:33,30:41,great and we would have set the parent ok the parent of is going to be and ok the parent of is going to be and ok the parent of is going to be and now we are going to process dfs g with now we are going to process dfs g with
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,30:41,30:47,now we are going to process dfs g with when we are running the dfs on to its when we are running the dfs on to its when we are running the dfs on to its color would have been set to gray and color would have been set to gray and
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,30:47,30:58,color would have been set to gray and then for each neighbor of we will have then for each neighbor of we will have then for each neighbor of we will have to process this particular code and we to process this particular code and we to process this particular code and we will have to process this code segment
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,30:58,31:11,will have to process this code segment will have to process this code segment for every neighbor of to has three for every neighbor of to has three for every neighbor of to has three neighbors namely and but out of neighbors namely and but out of neighbors namely and but out of them only amp are white and therefore
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,31:11,31:16,them only amp are white and therefore them only amp are white and therefore those alone will be processed okay so those alone will be processed okay so those alone will be processed okay so let us say vertex is going to be let us say vertex is going to be
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,31:16,31:27,let us say vertex is going to be processed first so its parent is going processed first so its parent is going processed first so its parent is going to be set to and while dfs g is being to be set to and while dfs g is being to be set to and while dfs g is being processed this
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,31:27,31:36,processed this processed this well turn into a gray node once this is well turn into a gray node once this is well turn into a gray node once this is a gray node we will have to explore all a gray node we will have to explore all a gray node we will have to explore all its neighbors it has four neighbors two
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,31:36,31:44,its neighbors it has four neighbors two its neighbors it has four neighbors two three six and seven the white neighbors three six and seven the white neighbors three six and seven the white neighbors are three of them three six and seven so are three of them three six and seven so
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,31:44,31:52,are three of them three six and seven so assumably all of them will essentially assumably all of them will essentially assumably all of them will essentially be processed and just say dfs for when be processed and just say dfs for when be processed and just say dfs for when it is being called the neighbor that is
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,31:52,32:02,it is being called the neighbor that is it is being called the neighbor that is big is that this picked first is vertex big is that this picked first is vertex big is that this picked first is vertex number seven okay and therefore the number seven okay and therefore the
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,32:02,32:10,number seven okay and therefore the parent would be set and seven would turn parent would be set and seven would turn parent would be set and seven would turn gray and dfs seven is going to be gray and dfs seven is going to be gray and dfs seven is going to be processed
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,32:10,32:20,processed processed dfs seven is processed seven has two dfs seven is processed seven has two dfs seven is processed seven has two neighbors namely four and five the only neighbors namely four and five the only neighbors namely four and five the only white neighbor is going to be five so
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,32:20,32:27,white neighbor is going to be five so white neighbor is going to be five so that is going to be a dfs five when df that is going to be a dfs five when df that is going to be a dfs five when df and the parent is going to be set and
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,32:27,32:34,and the parent is going to be set and and the parent is going to be set and dfs five will look at all its neighbors dfs five will look at all its neighbors dfs five will look at all its neighbors its neighbors are three and seven and its neighbors are three and seven and
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,32:34,32:45,its neighbors are three and seven and three is still white in color so that three is still white in color so that three is still white in color so that would be processed and that turns gray would be processed and that turns gray would be processed and that turns gray and when you are processing three the
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,32:45,32:51,and when you are processing three the and when you are processing three the only neighbor of three that is still in only neighbor of three that is still in only neighbor of three that is still in contention is six so it will directly go contention is six so it will directly go
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,32:51,33:02,contention is six so it will directly go to six let us look at the situation now to six let us look at the situation now to six let us look at the situation now when six would have turned to gray and when six would have turned to gray and
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,33:02,33:17,when six would have turned to gray and all the neighbors of six are of color all the neighbors of six are of color all the neighbors of six are of color other than white so the call will return other than white so the call will return other than white so the call will return back to three okay lets just one more
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,33:17,33:29,back to three okay lets just one more back to three okay lets just one more neighbor if we had a neighbor eight which is if we had a neighbor eight which is connected to both one and two okay connected to both one and two okay connected to both one and two okay the recursive calls would have happened
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,33:29,33:37,the recursive calls would have happened the recursive calls would have happened in the same way if you look at six all in the same way if you look at six all in the same way if you look at six all its neighbors has been processed so its neighbors has been processed so
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,33:37,33:44,its neighbors has been processed so youll go to three and three also every youll go to three and three also every youll go to three and three also every neighbor has been processed neighbor has been processed neighbor has been processed theres no neighbor of three which is of
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,33:44,33:50,theres no neighbor of three which is of theres no neighbor of three which is of color right and therefore it goes back color right and therefore it goes back color right and therefore it goes back to five and from five it goes back to to five and from five it goes back to
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,33:50,33:56,to five and from five it goes back to seven from seven it goes back to four seven from seven it goes back to four seven from seven it goes back to four because all the neighbors of these nodes because all the neighbors of these nodes because all the neighbors of these nodes were already processed when you come
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,33:56,34:03,were already processed when you come were already processed when you come back to two the two had lot of neighbors back to two the two had lot of neighbors back to two the two had lot of neighbors namely six four one and eight but the namely six four one and eight but the
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,34:03,34:11,namely six four one and eight but the only neighbor which is still white in only neighbor which is still white in only neighbor which is still white in color as eight so that will be processed color as eight so that will be processed color as eight so that will be processed okay and the parent would essentially be
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,34:11,34:22,okay and the parent would essentially be okay and the parent would essentially be pointing to two and this should become pointing to two and this should become pointing to two and this should become great and at this point all the calls great and at this point all the calls
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,34:22,34:29,great and at this point all the calls have been serviced and it has no longer have been serviced and it has no longer have been serviced and it has no longer any other neighbor i mean it doesnt any other neighbor i mean it doesnt any other neighbor i mean it doesnt have any neighbor which is white in
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,34:29,34:35,have any neighbor which is white in have any neighbor which is white in color and therefore the entire process color and therefore the entire process color and therefore the entire process it means over should have checked that it means over should have checked that it means over should have checked that while we are returning these calls they
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,34:35,34:44,while we are returning these calls they while we are returning these calls they know the color has changed from gray to know the color has changed from gray to know the color has changed from gray to black okay so the place where we would black okay so the place where we would
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,34:44,34:51,black okay so the place where we would have ended up search initially would have ended up search initially would have ended up search initially would have been six so at node sick when we have been six so at node sick when we have been six so at node sick when we were at node six all its neighbors were
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,34:51,34:56,were at node six all its neighbors were were at node six all its neighbors were processed and at that point this would processed and at that point this would processed and at that point this would have turned black okay six would have have turned black okay six would have
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,34:56,35:02,have turned black okay six would have turned black and then we would have come turned black and then we would have come turned black and then we would have come back two three and all labors of three back two three and all labors of three back two three and all labors of three have been processed so this would have
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,35:02,35:10,have been processed so this would have have been processed so this would have again been turned to black okay and then again been turned to black okay and then again been turned to black okay and then wendy call returns to five this would wendy call returns to five this would
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,35:10,35:16,wendy call returns to five this would have become black and then that call have become black and then that call have become black and then that call returns to seven and sevens call is also returns to seven and sevens call is also returns to seven and sevens call is also serviced this becomes relaxed this would
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,35:16,35:23,serviced this becomes relaxed this would serviced this becomes relaxed this would have become black and the call returns have become black and the call returns have become black and the call returns back to two two has one more neighbor to back to two two has one more neighbor to
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,35:23,35:29,back to two two has one more neighbor to be processed eight after its processing be processed eight after its processing be processed eight after its processing is done this becomes black and then two is done this becomes black and then two is done this becomes black and then two becomes black and then one
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,35:29,35:38,becomes black and then one becomes black and then one becomes black okay and at this point we becomes black okay and at this point we becomes black okay and at this point we have the we have a tree which is have the we have a tree which is
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,35:38,35:53,have the we have a tree which is obtained by looking at the predecessor obtained by looking at the predecessor obtained by looking at the predecessor nodes thats what we will call as the nodes thats what we will call as the nodes thats what we will call as the dfs tree this entire dfs operation which
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,35:53,35:59,dfs tree this entire dfs operation which dfs tree this entire dfs operation which we did via means of recursive calls we we did via means of recursive calls we we did via means of recursive calls we can implement it by means of a stack so can implement it by means of a stack so
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,35:59,36:05,can implement it by means of a stack so each recursive call instead of it being each recursive call instead of it being each recursive call instead of it being automatically serviced by means of stack automatically serviced by means of stack automatically serviced by means of stack we can explicitly construct our own
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,36:05,36:10,we can explicitly construct our own we can explicitly construct our own stack and push the vertices into the stack and push the vertices into the stack and push the vertices into the stack and pop it out from the stack as stack and pop it out from the stack as
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,36:10,36:17,stack and pop it out from the stack as and when those vertices are processed so and when those vertices are processed so and when those vertices are processed so in either case we can implement the in either case we can implement the in either case we can implement the algorithm in linear time assuming that
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,36:17,36:25,algorithm in linear time assuming that algorithm in linear time assuming that the the graph was given in an adjacency the the graph was given in an adjacency the the graph was given in an adjacency list format so this is about dfs in dfs list format so this is about dfs in dfs
215.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,36:25,36:33,list format so this is about dfs in dfs we will stop here for the time being so we will stop here for the time being so we will stop here for the time being so thats the end of this lecture
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,0:09,0:37,music music you music music you in this lecture we will learn about flow in this lecture we will learn about flow networks so flow and it works are networks so flow and it works are networks so flow and it works are nothing but capacitated directed graphs nothing but capacitated directed graphs
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,0:37,0:48,nothing but capacitated directed graphs let us formally define what are flow let us formally define what are flow let us formally define what are flow networks so flow networks has two networks so flow networks has two networks so flow networks has two components first is a directed graph so
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,0:48,0:55,components first is a directed graph so components first is a directed graph so g denote it by the graph by z v comma e g denote it by the graph by z v comma e g denote it by the graph by z v comma e b is a set of vertices and e is a set of
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,0:55,1:06,b is a set of vertices and e is a set of b is a set of vertices and e is a set of edges okay and this is the directed edges okay and this is the directed edges okay and this is the directed graph this would mean that the edges if
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,1:06,1:12,graph this would mean that the edges if graph this would mean that the edges if we denote as by u comma v theres a we denote as by u comma v theres a we denote as by u comma v theres a direction of the h it goes from u to v
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,1:12,1:25,direction of the h it goes from u to v direction of the h it goes from u to v and not v to u and the second component and not v to u and the second component and not v to u and the second component of a flow network is a capacity on edges
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,1:25,1:38,so we can think of that as a function so we can think of that as a function that is says c from the set of edges to that is says c from the set of edges to that is says c from the set of edges to positive reals
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,1:38,1:47,that would mean for every edge there is that would mean for every edge there is a number associated with it a a number associated with it a a number associated with it a nonnegative number which we will refer nonnegative number which we will refer nonnegative number which we will refer to as a capacity of the edge so we will
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,1:47,1:58,to as a capacity of the edge so we will to as a capacity of the edge so we will use the notation c e or its a c of e to use the notation c e or its a c of e to use the notation c e or its a c of e to indicate the capacity of the edge v so
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,1:58,2:25,indicate the capacity of the edge v so indicate the capacity of the edge v so let us see an example of such a network so this network has six vertices so this network has six vertices numbered to and there are some numbered to and there are some numbered to and there are some number of edges the edges i have given
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,2:25,2:31,number of edges the edges i have given number of edges the edges i have given it a direction so was an edge it a direction so was an edge it a direction so was an edge whereas is not an edge in this whereas is not an edge in this
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,2:31,2:40,whereas is not an edge in this particular graph but you could have particular graph but you could have particular graph but you could have edges going in both direction so since edges going in both direction so since edges going in both direction so since we are looking at directed edges we
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,2:40,2:44,we are looking at directed edges we we are looking at directed edges we could have an edge going in the backward could have an edge going in the backward could have an edge going in the backward direction as well so this would be a direction as well so this would be a
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,2:44,2:53,direction as well so this would be a flow network and there are theres a flow network and there are theres a flow network and there are theres a third component third component are the third component third component are the third component third component are the source and destination there are two
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,2:53,3:00,source and destination there are two source and destination there are two vertices s comma t belonging to v which vertices s comma t belonging to v which vertices s comma t belonging to v which we will call as a source and destination we will call as a source and destination
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,3:00,3:05,we will call as a source and destination so in this if our s is the vertex one so in this if our s is the vertex one so in this if our s is the vertex one then this is what we will call as a then this is what we will call as a
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,3:05,3:18,then this is what we will call as a source and six is what we will call as a source and six is what we will call as a source and six is what we will call as a destination so flow networks contains destination so flow networks contains destination so flow networks contains three parts first as a directed graph
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,3:18,3:24,three parts first as a directed graph three parts first as a directed graph second is a capacity on the edges and second is a capacity on the edges and second is a capacity on the edges and the third is two designated vertices the third is two designated vertices
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,3:24,3:35,the third is two designated vertices which we will refer to as source and which we will refer to as source and which we will refer to as source and destination we will further assume that destination we will further assume that destination we will further assume that all the edges that involve the edge
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,3:35,3:42,all the edges that involve the edge all the edges that involve the edge vertex s are outgoing edges so here this vertex s are outgoing edges so here this vertex s are outgoing edges so here this there will be a small trouble in this there will be a small trouble in this
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,3:42,3:51,there will be a small trouble in this particular diagram in particular to the particular diagram in particular to the particular diagram in particular to the three one edges an incoming edge its an three one edges an incoming edge its an three one edges an incoming edge its an incoming edge at the vertex one so what
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,3:51,3:56,incoming edge at the vertex one so what incoming edge at the vertex one so what we will assume is that there are no such we will assume is that there are no such we will assume is that there are no such edges so these are just would be an
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,3:56,4:03,edges so these are just would be an edges so these are just would be an outgoing edge and at the destination all outgoing edge and at the destination all outgoing edge and at the destination all the edges are incoming edges so these the edges are incoming edges so these
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,4:03,4:10,the edges are incoming edges so these are the restriction capacities has to be are the restriction capacities has to be are the restriction capacities has to be positive and the source all their edges positive and the source all their edges positive and the source all their edges are outgoing edges at the destination
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,4:10,4:16,are outgoing edges at the destination are outgoing edges at the destination all the edges are incoming edges and at all the edges are incoming edges and at all the edges are incoming edges and at the internal nodes that is the knowns the internal nodes that is the knowns
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,4:16,4:25,the internal nodes that is the knowns that have neither source nor destination that have neither source nor destination that have neither source nor destination the edges could be in either direction the edges could be in either direction the edges could be in either direction so this is the definition of a flow
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,4:25,4:40,so this is the definition of a flow so this is the definition of a flow network here we havent put the edge network here we havent put the edge network here we havent put the edge weights weights weights so we could put them so now i put some
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,4:40,4:46,so we could put them so now i put some so we could put them so now i put some numbers on the edges those denotes its numbers on the edges those denotes its numbers on the edges those denotes its capacity okay so see of the edge is capacity okay so see of the edge is
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,4:46,4:55,capacity okay so see of the edge is going to be the interpretation that we going to be the interpretation that we going to be the interpretation that we are going to give to those is we can are going to give to those is we can are going to give to those is we can think of this as pipes which can carry a
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,4:55,5:04,think of this as pipes which can carry a think of this as pipes which can carry a certain amount of fluid okay certain amount of fluid okay certain amount of fluid okay and the amount the maximum amount of and the amount the maximum amount of and the amount the maximum amount of fluid that it can carries is bounded by
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,5:04,5:10,fluid that it can carries is bounded by fluid that it can carries is bounded by the capacity of the edge and the problem the capacity of the edge and the problem the capacity of the edge and the problem that we are interested in solving is that we are interested in solving is
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,5:10,5:22,that we are interested in solving is what is the maximum amount of flow that what is the maximum amount of flow that what is the maximum amount of flow that we can take from source to destination we can take from source to destination we can take from source to destination so there are additional assumptions what
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,5:22,5:29,so there are additional assumptions what so there are additional assumptions what are the conditions that should be met are the conditions that should be met are the conditions that should be met there are since we are thinking of this there are since we are thinking of this there are since we are thinking of this as fluid flow we can say that there are
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,5:29,5:38,as fluid flow we can say that there are as fluid flow we can say that there are some natural conservation criteria that some natural conservation criteria that some natural conservation criteria that each node should satisfy in particular each node should satisfy in particular each node should satisfy in particular at any of the internal nodes the
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,5:38,5:44,at any of the internal nodes the at any of the internal nodes the incoming flow must be equal to the incoming flow must be equal to the incoming flow must be equal to the outgoing flow and on any edge the outgoing flow and on any edge the outgoing flow and on any edge the maximum amount of flow that can be there
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,5:44,5:49,maximum amount of flow that can be there maximum amount of flow that can be there is going to be bounded by the capacity is going to be bounded by the capacity is going to be bounded by the capacity of that edge okay so we will formally of that edge okay so we will formally
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,5:49,5:59,of that edge okay so we will formally define water flow is and the objective define water flow is and the objective define water flow is and the objective of this lecture would be to have a of this lecture would be to have a of this lecture would be to have a procedure or characterize what is the
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,5:59,6:17,procedure or characterize what is the procedure or characterize what is the maximum flow that is possible in a flow maximum flow that is possible in a flow maximum flow that is possible in a flow network network network so lets formally define what a flow is the flow we will denote it by f and
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,6:17,6:30,the flow we will denote it by f and thats a function from edge to reals so thats a function from edge to reals so thats a function from edge to reals so at each edge we are assigning certain at each edge we are assigning certain at each edge we are assigning certain amount of flow and this should satisfy
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,6:30,6:44,amount of flow and this should satisfy amount of flow and this should satisfy some conditions the first condition is some conditions the first condition is some conditions the first condition is the capacity condition which states that the capacity condition which states that the capacity condition which states that music
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,6:44,7:02,music music f ii should be less than or equal to c f ii should be less than or equal to c f ii should be less than or equal to c ii for all e belonging to the edge set the maximum amount of flow that can be the maximum amount of flow that can be routed through any particular edge is
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,7:02,7:18,routed through any particular edge is routed through any particular edge is bounded by the capacity of that bounded by the capacity of that bounded by the capacity of that particular edge the second condition is particular edge the second condition is particular edge the second condition is the conservation criteria
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,7:18,7:30,which says that the amount of flow that which says that the amount of flow that comes into a net into a an internal node comes into a net into a an internal node comes into a net into a an internal node should be equal to the amount of flow
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,7:30,7:38,should be equal to the amount of flow should be equal to the amount of flow that leaves that particular node this that leaves that particular node this that leaves that particular node this should be satisfied for all nodes except should be satisfied for all nodes except should be satisfied for all nodes except source and destination okay so we will
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,7:38,7:49,source and destination okay so we will source and destination okay so we will just write this as inflow should be just write this as inflow should be just write this as inflow should be equal to outflow we will formally define equal to outflow we will formally define equal to outflow we will formally define what these terms are okay but this is
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,7:49,8:07,what these terms are okay but this is what these terms are okay but this is what the conservation criterion says what the conservation criterion says what the conservation criterion says inflow is equal to outflow so at every internal node so nodes other than snt internal node so nodes other than snt are what we refer to as internal nodes
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,8:07,8:13,are what we refer to as internal nodes are what we refer to as internal nodes at every internal node the incoming flow at every internal node the incoming flow at every internal node the incoming flow is equal to the out outgoing flow okay is equal to the out outgoing flow okay
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,8:13,8:23,is equal to the out outgoing flow okay so lets try an example and construct so lets try an example and construct so lets try an example and construct the flow on this particular flow network the flow on this particular flow network the flow on this particular flow network so let us say i have one unit flowing
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,8:23,8:29,so let us say i have one unit flowing so let us say i have one unit flowing from one to two and this is also one so from one to two and this is also one so from one to two and this is also one so all my flows are going to be of unit
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,8:29,8:45,all my flows are going to be of unit all my flows are going to be of unit size and that will be indicated by a size and that will be indicated by a size and that will be indicated by a blue line okay so if i look at this flow you can
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,8:45,8:54,okay so if i look at this flow you can verify that at every node the incoming verify that at every node the incoming verify that at every node the incoming flow is equal to the outgoing flow flow is equal to the outgoing flow flow is equal to the outgoing flow because one unit is coming in and one
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,8:54,9:00,because one unit is coming in and one because one unit is coming in and one good one unit is going out okay so this good one unit is going out okay so this good one unit is going out okay so this is a network where the flow is bounded
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,9:00,9:08,is a network where the flow is bounded is a network where the flow is bounded by i mean the so this is a if you take by i mean the so this is a if you take by i mean the so this is a if you take these blue edges we get a valid flow and
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,9:08,9:16,these blue edges we get a valid flow and these blue edges we get a valid flow and at any node if you look at it carefully at any node if you look at it carefully at any node if you look at it carefully you can see that i mean at any edge the
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,9:16,9:19,you can see that i mean at any edge the you can see that i mean at any edge the maximum amount of flow is only one and maximum amount of flow is only one and maximum amount of flow is only one and therefore it naturally means the therefore it naturally means the
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,9:19,9:31,therefore it naturally means the capacity criterion now we could look at capacity criterion now we could look at capacity criterion now we could look at increasing the flows so let me just increasing the flows so let me just increasing the flows so let me just indicate it by numbers okay so let us
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,9:31,9:46,indicate it by numbers okay so let us indicate it by numbers okay so let us say if i had sent three units through say if i had sent three units through say if i had sent three units through this and four units through this so this and four units through this so
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,9:46,9:56,this and four units through this so there should be three flowing through there should be three flowing through there should be three flowing through this leads to four and before that comes this leads to four and before that comes this leads to four and before that comes here it could be either routed through
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,9:56,10:01,here it could be either routed through here it could be either routed through the edge or through three five eight the edge or through three five eight the edge or through three five eight three five edge i can send only two and three five edge i can send only two and
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,10:01,10:11,three five edge i can send only two and the remaining two goes here and five the remaining two goes here and five the remaining two goes here and five comes here and five goes here and two comes here and five goes here and two comes here and five goes here and two comes here okay so this is a little more
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,10:11,10:26,comes here okay so this is a little more comes here okay so this is a little more involved flow the sense more edges are involved flow the sense more edges are involved flow the sense more edges are participating in this flow the flow still respects the capacity the flow still respects the capacity conditions and the conservation
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,10:26,10:33,conditions and the conservation conditions and the conservation criterion but the amount that is flowing criterion but the amount that is flowing criterion but the amount that is flowing from the source to destination is equal from the source to destination is equal from the source to destination is equal to seven units it is better than the
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,10:33,10:42,to seven units it is better than the to seven units it is better than the previous two but is this the best previous two but is this the best previous two but is this the best possible can we find anything possible can we find anything possible can we find anything significantly better than this okay in
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,10:42,10:48,significantly better than this okay in significantly better than this okay in fact in this we can argue that it is not fact in this we can argue that it is not fact in this we can argue that it is not possible to find any flow which does possible to find any flow which does
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,10:48,10:52,possible to find any flow which does better than this okay so thats the better than this okay so thats the better than this okay so thats the theorem that we will learn later on in theorem that we will learn later on in theorem that we will learn later on in this lecture
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,10:52,11:03,this lecture this lecture thats called as a maxflow mincut thats called as a maxflow mincut thats called as a maxflow mincut theorem okay so if you use the maxflow theorem okay so if you use the maxflow theorem okay so if you use the maxflow mincut theorem we can say that in this
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,11:03,11:08,mincut theorem we can say that in this mincut theorem we can say that in this particular network we cannot expect to particular network we cannot expect to particular network we cannot expect to get a flow of value greater than seven get a flow of value greater than seven
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,11:08,11:14,get a flow of value greater than seven we havent yet defined what is the value we havent yet defined what is the value we havent yet defined what is the value of a flow we will do that this is just a of a flow we will do that this is just a
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,11:14,11:22,of a flow we will do that this is just a glimpse of what we will be saying in the glimpse of what we will be saying in the glimpse of what we will be saying in the remainder of this lecture okay so so far remainder of this lecture okay so so far
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,11:22,11:31,remainder of this lecture okay so so far we have defined what is a capacitated we have defined what is a capacitated we have defined what is a capacitated network and weve defined water flow is network and weve defined water flow is network and weve defined water flow is a flow is some assignment of
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,11:31,11:40,a flow is some assignment of a flow is some assignment of nonnegative integers to the edges in nonnegative integers to the edges in nonnegative integers to the edges in such a way that the capacity criterion such a way that the capacity criterion such a way that the capacity criterion are met at every edge and the
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,11:40,11:47,are met at every edge and the are met at every edge and the conservation criterion are met at every conservation criterion are met at every conservation criterion are met at every node now we will define what is a value node now we will define what is a value
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,11:47,12:02,node now we will define what is a value of a flow so so badly of a flow is of a flow so so badly of a flow is of a flow so so badly of a flow is defined as summation over all the edges defined as summation over all the edges
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,12:02,12:16,defined as summation over all the edges e out of s if e the flow naturally e out of s if e the flow naturally e out of s if e the flow naturally associates nonnegative integers to associates nonnegative integers to associates nonnegative integers to every edge now look at all the edges at
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,12:16,12:22,every edge now look at all the edges at every edge now look at all the edges at s all the edges are outgoing at this if s all the edges are outgoing at this if s all the edges are outgoing at this if you sum up the flows of all of them what
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,12:22,12:29,you sum up the flows of all of them what you sum up the flows of all of them what you what we would get is referred to as you what we would get is referred to as you what we would get is referred to as the value of the flow our objective is
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,12:29,12:51,the value of the flow our objective is the value of the flow our objective is to maximize the value find the flow to maximize the value find the flow to maximize the value find the flow which maximizes v of f find a flow f such that v of f is
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,12:51,13:06,find a flow f such that v of f is maximized lets understand this quantity maximized lets understand this quantity maximized lets understand this quantity v of s carefully so we will define some v of s carefully so we will define some v of s carefully so we will define some additional quantities so f is defined
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,13:06,13:13,additional quantities so f is defined additional quantities so f is defined for each individual edge we will define for each individual edge we will define for each individual edge we will define f out at a particular vertex let us say f out at a particular vertex let us say
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,13:13,13:25,f out at a particular vertex let us say u so this is defined as the outgoing u so this is defined as the outgoing u so this is defined as the outgoing flow at vertex u so that would be flow at vertex u so that would be flow at vertex u so that would be summation over all edge e
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,13:25,13:48,summation over all edge e summation over all edge e out of you f e and similarly we can out of you f e and similarly we can out of you f e and similarly we can define f in of u is summation e into u f define f in of u is summation e into u f
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,13:48,13:55,define f in of u is summation e into u f of e okay so if you have a particular of e okay so if you have a particular of e okay so if you have a particular vertex u and there are lots of incoming vertex u and there are lots of incoming
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,13:55,14:03,vertex u and there are lots of incoming edges and each of them carry a flow so edges and each of them carry a flow so edges and each of them carry a flow so let us say this is f e is f e and let us say this is f e is f e and
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,14:03,14:08,let us say this is f e is f e and this is f e if you sum up over these this is f e if you sum up over these this is f e if you sum up over these whatever you get is f in of u and
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,14:08,14:16,whatever you get is f in of u and whatever you get is f in of u and similarly if you have lot of outgoing similarly if you have lot of outgoing similarly if you have lot of outgoing edges so lets say f e e versus ig edges so lets say f e e versus ig
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,14:16,14:25,edges so lets say f e e versus ig amp e the flow on the edge g that is fe amp e the flow on the edge g that is fe amp e the flow on the edge g that is fe and sum up over all those outgoing and sum up over all those outgoing
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,14:25,14:31,and sum up over all those outgoing edges they are flows what you get is f edges they are flows what you get is f edges they are flows what you get is f out of u and therefore we can say that out of u and therefore we can say that
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,14:31,14:45,out of u and therefore we can say that value of the flow is now simply f out of value of the flow is now simply f out of value of the flow is now simply f out of s because s was our starting vertex the s because s was our starting vertex the
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,14:45,14:53,s because s was our starting vertex the source vertex the flow out of s is source vertex the flow out of s is source vertex the flow out of s is defined as the and that that was defined as the and that that was defined as the and that that was basically the definition of the value of
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,14:53,15:02,basically the definition of the value of basically the definition of the value of the flow so f the flow so f the flow so f was a function from vertices to real was a function from vertices to real was a function from vertices to real numbers now we can extend it as
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,15:02,15:08,numbers now we can extend it as numbers now we can extend it as functions from i mean subset of vertices functions from i mean subset of vertices functions from i mean subset of vertices ok so s subset of v r plus we can ok so s subset of v r plus we can
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,15:08,15:19,ok so s subset of v r plus we can extend it in a natural fashion so f out extend it in a natural fashion so f out extend it in a natural fashion so f out of s would be so this is a set of of s would be so this is a set of
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,15:19,15:26,of s would be so this is a set of vertices so lets call this as s and vertices so lets call this as s and vertices so lets call this as s and there are a lot of edges which leave s there are a lot of edges which leave s
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,15:26,15:36,there are a lot of edges which leave s and of course their edges that come into and of course their edges that come into and of course their edges that come into s this is the incoming edges lets mark s this is the incoming edges lets mark s this is the incoming edges lets mark in red outgoing in black itself and then
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,15:36,15:43,in red outgoing in black itself and then in red outgoing in black itself and then there are other edges which are within s there are other edges which are within s there are other edges which are within s itself okay so if you sum up over all itself okay so if you sum up over all
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,15:43,15:52,itself okay so if you sum up over all the outgoing edges their sum will be f the outgoing edges their sum will be f the outgoing edges their sum will be f out of s so this is summation e out of s out of s so this is summation e out of s
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,15:52,16:02,out of s so this is summation e out of s so that is summed over all the edges so that is summed over all the edges so that is summed over all the edges that are outgoing edges with respect to that are outgoing edges with respect to that are outgoing edges with respect to s their flow if you sum it up f e that
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,16:02,16:08,s their flow if you sum it up f e that s their flow if you sum it up f e that will be f out of s and similarly you can will be f out of s and similarly you can will be f out of s and similarly you can have f in of s which will be equal to so
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,16:08,16:15,have f in of s which will be equal to so have f in of s which will be equal to so this s is the capital s not to be this s is the capital s not to be this s is the capital s not to be confused to the source vertex summation
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,16:15,16:26,confused to the source vertex summation confused to the source vertex summation e in to s fe that will be f in of s and e in to s fe that will be f in of s and e in to s fe that will be f in of s and therefore we can verify that value of
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,16:26,16:34,therefore we can verify that value of therefore we can verify that value of the flow is also equal to value of a set the flow is also equal to value of a set the flow is also equal to value of a set which contains the vertex s and doesnt
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,16:34,16:40,which contains the vertex s and doesnt which contains the vertex s and doesnt contain the vertex t so if you sum up or contain the vertex t so if you sum up or contain the vertex t so if you sum up or any collection of vertices which any collection of vertices which
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,16:40,16:48,any collection of vertices which contains s but doesnt contain t that contains s but doesnt contain t that contains s but doesnt contain t that will also be the value of the flow okay will also be the value of the flow okay will also be the value of the flow okay so lets see why that is the case so we
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,16:48,17:02,so lets see why that is the case so we so lets see why that is the case so we will first define what is a cut call will first define what is a cut call will first define what is a cut call this as an s to t cut an st cut in a
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,17:02,17:38,this as an s to t cut an st cut in a this as an s to t cut an st cut in a graph g is groups or two parts such that one part groups or two parts such that one part contains s and the other contains t okay
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,17:38,17:44,contains s and the other contains t okay contains s and the other contains t okay so these are the vertices if we split it so these are the vertices if we split it so these are the vertices if we split it into two parts and this part contains s
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,17:44,17:50,into two parts and this part contains s into two parts and this part contains s in this part contains t then this split in this part contains t then this split in this part contains t then this split is called as an sd card and if you look
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,17:50,17:57,is called as an sd card and if you look is called as an sd card and if you look at the edges of the graph the edges are at the edges of the graph the edges are at the edges of the graph the edges are of four kinds the edges which have both
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,17:57,18:04,of four kinds the edges which have both of four kinds the edges which have both its endpoints in s itself so there are its endpoints in s itself so there are its endpoints in s itself so there are these kind of edges we would start and these kind of edges we would start and
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,18:04,18:10,these kind of edges we would start and end in s and there are these edges which end in s and there are these edges which end in s and there are these edges which start and end in t and there are these start and end in t and there are these
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,18:10,18:15,start and end in t and there are these other edges which start from s and go to other edges which start from s and go to other edges which start from s and go to t and then there are these edges which t and then there are these edges which
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,18:15,18:22,t and then there are these edges which starts from t and comes to s and these starts from t and comes to s and these starts from t and comes to s and these edges which go across the cut that is edges which go across the cut that is
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,18:22,18:28,edges which go across the cut that is from s to t or t to s they are called as from s to t or t to s they are called as from s to t or t to s they are called as a cut edges so we will know through
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,18:28,18:52,a cut edges so we will know through a cut edges so we will know through theorem so let f be any flow from s to t theorem so let f be any flow from s to t theorem so let f be any flow from s to t and a comma b be an st cut when we say a
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,18:52,18:57,and a comma b be an st cut when we say a and a comma b be an st cut when we say a comma b is an st cut what we mean is a comma b is an st cut what we mean is a comma b is an st cut what we mean is a is a collection of vertices which
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,18:57,19:12,is a collection of vertices which is a collection of vertices which contain s and b is a another b is the contain s and b is a another b is the contain s and b is a another b is the complement of a which contains vertex t then value of the flow is equal to f out
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,19:12,19:26,then value of the flow is equal to f out a minus f in a minus f in a minus f in of a okay so we had defined what is f of a okay so we had defined what is f of a okay so we had defined what is f out and f in for a collection of
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,19:26,19:35,out and f in for a collection of out and f in for a collection of vertices so f out of a is a sum over the vertices so f out of a is a sum over the vertices so f out of a is a sum over the flow over every edge that leaves a and f
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,19:35,19:42,flow over every edge that leaves a and f flow over every edge that leaves a and f in a is the sum over the flows of every in a is the sum over the flows of every in a is the sum over the flows of every edge that comes into it and this
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,19:42,19:47,edge that comes into it and this edge that comes into it and this difference will be equal to value of the difference will be equal to value of the difference will be equal to value of the flow okay the proof is very simple its flow okay the proof is very simple its
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,19:47,20:00,flow okay the proof is very simple its basically putting all the definitions basically putting all the definitions basically putting all the definitions together so a is the set together so a is the set together so a is the set it contains s okay so now we have all
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,20:00,20:10,it contains s okay so now we have all it contains s okay so now we have all these outgoing edges and what we want is these outgoing edges and what we want is these outgoing edges and what we want is a sum over all these outgoing edges that
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,20:10,20:19,a sum over all these outgoing edges that a sum over all these outgoing edges that will be our f out a so outgoing edges will be our f out a so outgoing edges will be our f out a so outgoing edges will be marking in red and incoming
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,20:19,20:32,will be marking in red and incoming will be marking in red and incoming edges lets mark in green okay our rhs edges lets mark in green okay our rhs edges lets mark in green okay our rhs is going to be sum over the black edges is going to be sum over the black edges
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,20:32,20:43,is going to be sum over the black edges minus sum over the green edges okay minus sum over the green edges okay minus sum over the green edges okay whatever is the flow on these edges they whatever is the flow on these edges they whatever is the flow on these edges they have to be added up appropriately the
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,20:43,20:47,have to be added up appropriately the have to be added up appropriately the black edges you add up the green edges black edges you add up the green edges black edges you add up the green edges you add up subtract them what you get is you add up subtract them what you get is
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,20:47,21:00,you add up subtract them what you get is the rhs whereas the lhs is going to be the rhs whereas the lhs is going to be the rhs whereas the lhs is going to be the sum of the outgoing edges at s s is the sum of the outgoing edges at s s is
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,21:00,21:03,the sum of the outgoing edges at s s is only outgoing edges so you look at all only outgoing edges so you look at all only outgoing edges so you look at all the red edge just their sum is going to the red edge just their sum is going to
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,21:03,21:08,the red edge just their sum is going to be your left hand side now we need to be your left hand side now we need to be your left hand side now we need to show that these two quantities are equal show that these two quantities are equal
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,21:08,21:23,show that these two quantities are equal so how do we do that so note that value so how do we do that so note that value so how do we do that so note that value at the flow is equal to f out of s minus at the flow is equal to f out of s minus
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,21:23,21:30,at the flow is equal to f out of s minus f in of s this is so because f out of s f in of s this is so because f out of s f in of s this is so because f out of s is the real value of f of
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,21:30,21:34,is the real value of f of is the real value of f of the value of the flow f in of s is zero the value of the flow f in of s is zero the value of the flow f in of s is zero so as this is we can write this
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,21:34,21:49,so as this is we can write this so as this is we can write this equation so f out minus f in for the equation so f out minus f in for the equation so f out minus f in for the particular node s if you do that what
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,21:49,21:54,particular node s if you do that what particular node s if you do that what you will get is a value the flow now for you will get is a value the flow now for you will get is a value the flow now for every other node in this graph
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,21:54,22:01,every other node in this graph every other node in this graph other than t t f out s minus f in s is other than t t f out s minus f in s is other than t t f out s minus f in s is going to be the conservation law says
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,22:01,22:07,going to be the conservation law says going to be the conservation law says that since f is a flow if you take this that since f is a flow if you take this that since f is a flow if you take this quantity out in for any other vertex
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,22:07,22:15,quantity out in for any other vertex quantity out in for any other vertex thats going to be so we can also thats going to be so we can also thats going to be so we can also write this as summation over all v write this as summation over all v
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,22:15,22:24,write this as summation over all v belonging to a f out v minus f in v is belonging to a f out v minus f in v is belonging to a f out v minus f in v is going to be equal to this quantity we going to be equal to this quantity we
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,22:24,22:33,going to be equal to this quantity we can write this because the vertex t is can write this because the vertex t is can write this because the vertex t is not there in this collection a the not there in this collection a the not there in this collection a the vertex t belongs to the part b so lets
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,22:33,22:39,vertex t belongs to the part b so lets vertex t belongs to the part b so lets look at the summation every vertex look at the summation every vertex look at the summation every vertex belonging to a it is either the vertex s belonging to a it is either the vertex s
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,22:39,22:45,belonging to a it is either the vertex s or it is a vertex for which f out v or it is a vertex for which f out v or it is a vertex for which f out v minus f in v is okay because the only minus f in v is okay because the only
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,22:45,22:53,minus f in v is okay because the only vertex for which it was nonzero or snt vertex for which it was nonzero or snt vertex for which it was nonzero or snt as we have already considered t is as we have already considered t is as we have already considered t is guaranteed to be not in a because a b is
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,22:53,23:00,guaranteed to be not in a because a b is guaranteed to be not in a because a b is an st cut okay so this summation is an st cut okay so this summation is an st cut okay so this summation is going to be value of the flow so this we
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,23:00,23:11,going to be value of the flow so this we going to be value of the flow so this we can just simply write it as summation v can just simply write it as summation v can just simply write it as summation v belonging to a f out v minus summation v
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,23:11,23:23,belonging to a f out v minus summation v belonging to a f out v minus summation v belonging to a f in v now if you look at belonging to a f in v now if you look at belonging to a f in v now if you look at this expression what this does is for
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,23:23,23:29,this expression what this does is for this expression what this does is for each vertex in a look at all the each vertex in a look at all the each vertex in a look at all the outgoing edges and for them you add f outgoing edges and for them you add f
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,23:29,23:39,outgoing edges and for them you add f out v ok so this is a particular edge we out v ok so this is a particular edge we out v ok so this is a particular edge we are going to add f ii while we compute are going to add f ii while we compute
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,23:39,23:48,are going to add f ii while we compute the first term of the summation okay the first term of the summation okay the first term of the summation okay now the edges now the edges now the edges can be of three kinds the internal edges can be of three kinds the internal edges
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,23:48,23:53,can be of three kinds the internal edges they are just that lies within a the they are just that lies within a the they are just that lies within a the edges that go from a to b or the edges edges that go from a to b or the edges
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,23:53,23:59,edges that go from a to b or the edges that comes from b to e these are the that comes from b to e these are the that comes from b to e these are the only kind of edges possible the edges only kind of edges possible the edges
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,23:59,24:04,only kind of edges possible the edges which are within b to b are not even which are within b to b are not even which are within b to b are not even considered so a to a edges what happens considered so a to a edges what happens
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,24:04,24:13,considered so a to a edges what happens to those edges for them fe is counted to those edges for them fe is counted to those edges for them fe is counted once as positive and once as negative once as positive and once as negative once as positive and once as negative okay so if you look at this entire
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,24:13,24:20,okay so if you look at this entire okay so if you look at this entire summation the internal edges are going summation the internal edges are going summation the internal edges are going to cancel out and the external edges are to cancel out and the external edges are
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,24:20,24:25,to cancel out and the external edges are the only thing that are going to remain the only thing that are going to remain the only thing that are going to remain so if you look at this term there are so if you look at this term there are
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,24:25,24:31,so if you look at this term there are going to be a lot of terms of the form f going to be a lot of terms of the form f going to be a lot of terms of the form f a i okay some of them is going to appear
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,24:31,24:37,a i okay some of them is going to appear a i okay some of them is going to appear as plus some of them are going to appear as plus some of them are going to appear as plus some of them are going to appear as negative okay so let us understand
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,24:37,24:48,as negative okay so let us understand as negative okay so let us understand which ones appear as positive and which which ones appear as positive and which which ones appear as positive and which ones appear as negative okay all the ones appear as negative okay all the ones appear as negative okay all the edges which lie within a they come in
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,24:48,24:56,edges which lie within a they come in edges which lie within a they come in both positive and negative and therefore both positive and negative and therefore both positive and negative and therefore they cancel out each other those edges they cancel out each other those edges they cancel out each other those edges which originate in a and end up in b are
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,24:56,25:01,which originate in a and end up in b are which originate in a and end up in b are going to come only in this is a positive going to come only in this is a positive going to come only in this is a positive format okay so one of them you give us
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,25:01,25:06,format okay so one of them you give us format okay so one of them you give us positive and the other is negative okay positive and the other is negative okay positive and the other is negative okay all the outgoing ones are the ones which all the outgoing ones are the ones which
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,25:06,25:16,all the outgoing ones are the ones which are going to be positive okay so this are going to be positive okay so this are going to be positive okay so this summation we can write as sum over summation we can write as sum over summation we can write as sum over so here the summation was over vertices
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,25:16,25:27,so here the summation was over vertices so here the summation was over vertices sum over it just e such that e is out of sum over it just e such that e is out of sum over it just e such that e is out of a if e those are the edges that were
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,25:27,25:33,a if e those are the edges that were a if e those are the edges that were going to remain and all those vertices going to remain and all those vertices going to remain and all those vertices which come from b to a they are also which come from b to a they are also
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,25:33,25:38,which come from b to a they are also going to remain because they are going going to remain because they are going going to remain because they are going to come in as part of f in no fee so to come in as part of f in no fee so
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,25:38,25:59,to come in as part of f in no fee so that will be summation e into a f e okay that will be summation e into a f e okay that will be summation e into a f e okay and this is going to be summation and this by definition is going to be f
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,25:59,26:08,and this by definition is going to be f out a minus f in a okay so that would out a minus f in a okay so that would out a minus f in a okay so that would mean that the value the flow is equal to mean that the value the flow is equal to
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,26:08,26:17,mean that the value the flow is equal to the quantity that we are interested in the quantity that we are interested in the quantity that we are interested in okay so from this what we can say is the okay so from this what we can say is the
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,26:17,26:33,okay so from this what we can say is the maximum value of any flow is bounded by maximum value of any flow is bounded by maximum value of any flow is bounded by the positive quantity in this term okay the positive quantity in this term okay the positive quantity in this term okay so we can get an upper bound on the flow
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,26:33,26:47,okay so we know that value of the flow okay so we know that value of the flow of any flow is going to be equal to f of any flow is going to be equal to f of any flow is going to be equal to f out of a minus f in of a and if you look
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,26:47,26:55,out of a minus f in of a and if you look out of a minus f in of a and if you look at any particular cut a the f out is at any particular cut a the f out is at any particular cut a the f out is going to be at most equal to the sum
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,26:55,26:59,going to be at most equal to the sum going to be at most equal to the sum over the capacities so there are a lot over the capacities so there are a lot over the capacities so there are a lot of outgoing edges lets say each their of outgoing edges lets say each their
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,26:59,27:10,of outgoing edges lets say each their capacity to see e see e c and so on capacity to see e see e c and so on capacity to see e see e c and so on see e k are the outgoing edges so f out see e k are the outgoing edges so f out
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,27:10,27:23,see e k are the outgoing edges so f out is going to be less than so this is going to be less than so this is going to be less than so this quantity is going to be less than quantity is going to be less than quantity is going to be less than summation e out of a c e and minus some
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,27:23,27:26,summation e out of a c e and minus some summation e out of a c e and minus some other quantity so we will just ignore other quantity so we will just ignore other quantity so we will just ignore that quantity because we are interested that quantity because we are interested
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,27:26,27:33,that quantity because we are interested in we upper bound and this quantity is in we upper bound and this quantity is in we upper bound and this quantity is what we call as the size of the cut okay what we call as the size of the cut okay
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,27:33,27:44,what we call as the size of the cut okay so we call that as c a b okay so if we so we call that as c a b okay so if we so we call that as c a b okay so if we call this value as the cut size what we
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,27:44,27:49,call this value as the cut size what we call this value as the cut size what we have shown right now is v f is going to have shown right now is v f is going to have shown right now is v f is going to be less than or equal to the size of the
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,27:49,27:55,be less than or equal to the size of the be less than or equal to the size of the cut what we will later on see is that cut what we will later on see is that cut what we will later on see is that there will be a flow such sac it matches
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,27:55,28:02,there will be a flow such sac it matches there will be a flow such sac it matches the size of the cut that will exist for the size of the cut that will exist for the size of the cut that will exist for any capacitated network we can find a
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,28:02,28:09,any capacitated network we can find a any capacitated network we can find a flow such that the value of that flow is flow such that the value of that flow is flow such that the value of that flow is going to be equal to the capacity of going to be equal to the capacity of
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,28:09,28:19,going to be equal to the capacity of some some some particular cut and that would be the particular cut and that would be the particular cut and that would be the maxflow mincut theorem here what it maxflow mincut theorem here what it maxflow mincut theorem here what it says is you take any cut the size of the
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,28:19,28:25,says is you take any cut the size of the says is you take any cut the size of the cut is a natural upper bound on the flow cut is a natural upper bound on the flow cut is a natural upper bound on the flow that is possible so in particular we can
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,28:25,28:39,that is possible so in particular we can that is possible so in particular we can write the maximum flow is going to be write the maximum flow is going to be write the maximum flow is going to be less than or equal to min cut define the less than or equal to min cut define the
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,28:39,28:53,less than or equal to min cut define the cut whose capacity is the least and this cut whose capacity is the least and this cut whose capacity is the least and this theorem says that any flows value cannot theorem says that any flows value cannot theorem says that any flows value cannot exceed the value of the min cut now how
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,28:53,28:58,exceed the value of the min cut now how exceed the value of the min cut now how do we show that these quantities the min do we show that these quantities the min do we show that these quantities the min cut will be equal to the max flow thats
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,28:58,29:05,cut will be equal to the max flow thats cut will be equal to the max flow thats what we will do in the remaining part of what we will do in the remaining part of what we will do in the remaining part of this lecture so you need some additional

216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,30:05,30:19,is also what is the maximum amount is also what is the maximum amount that can be whats a maximum possible that can be whats a maximum possible that can be whats a maximum possible flow okay so lets look at this flow okay so lets look at this flow okay so lets look at this particular path indicated by the green
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,30:19,30:30,particular path indicated by the green particular path indicated by the green line or green curve we can route line or green curve we can route line or green curve we can route units through this particular path units through this particular path units through this particular path without violating any of the conditions
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,30:30,30:38,without violating any of the conditions without violating any of the conditions okay but once we have routed units of okay but once we have routed units of okay but once we have routed units of flow we cannot send any additional flow flow we cannot send any additional flow
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,30:38,30:48,flow we cannot send any additional flow without affecting the already existing without affecting the already existing without affecting the already existing flow okay but clearly we could have let flow okay but clearly we could have let flow okay but clearly we could have let us say send units from to and
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,30:48,30:59,us say send units from to and us say send units from to and split to to okay so we could have split to to okay so we could have split to to okay so we could have done the following starts from here done the following starts from here
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,30:59,31:14,done the following starts from here goes here goes here and this goes here goes here and this goes here goes here and this goes here additionally comes from goes here additionally comes from goes here additionally comes from here and that is sent on this ok so you here and that is sent on this ok so you
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,31:14,31:27,here and that is sent on this ok so you could send units from to this is could send units from to this is could send units from to this is the source and this is the destination the source and this is the destination the source and this is the destination then you can send units okay and
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,31:27,31:32,then you can send units okay and then you can send units okay and thats going to be the maximum possible thats going to be the maximum possible thats going to be the maximum possible okay okay okay so lets look at this case where we were so lets look at this case where we were
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,31:32,31:42,so lets look at this case where we were only sending we are really sending only sending we are really sending only sending we are really sending units of flow from to using the units of flow from to using the units of flow from to using the green edges in that case we will have a
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,31:42,31:46,green edges in that case we will have a green edges in that case we will have a residual graph we will define the residual graph we will define the residual graph we will define the concept of the residual graph it will concept of the residual graph it will
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,31:46,31:57,concept of the residual graph it will look something something like this look something something like this look something something like this the capacity of this edges completely i the capacity of this edges completely i the capacity of this edges completely i mean its used to the extend of if you
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,31:57,32:03,mean its used to the extend of if you mean its used to the extend of if you look at the to edge the look at the to edge the look at the to edge the is already units flowing through that is already units flowing through that is already units flowing through that so we can reverse that so that will be
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,32:03,32:10,so we can reverse that so that will be so we can reverse that so that will be indicated by a back edge which can carry indicated by a back edge which can carry indicated by a back edge which can carry units and forward capacity has been units and forward capacity has been
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,32:10,32:22,units and forward capacity has been used to some extent units have been used to some extent units have been used to some extent units have been used so there is a remaining units used so there is a remaining units used so there is a remaining units that can be routed and theres
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,32:22,32:27,that can be routed and theres that can be routed and theres going to be there was a forward edge going to be there was a forward edge going to be there was a forward edge which is saturated so we can only send which is saturated so we can only send
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,32:27,32:41,which is saturated so we can only send back units along this and if you look back units along this and if you look back units along this and if you look at the vertex for this edge remains at the vertex for this edge remains at the vertex for this edge remains because all the units is available
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,32:41,32:50,because all the units is available because all the units is available you can route additional flow through you can route additional flow through you can route additional flow through this and to there was units going this and to there was units going this and to there was units going in the forward direction so there is a
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,32:50,32:58,in the forward direction so there is a in the forward direction so there is a unit in the backward direction and unit in the backward direction and unit in the backward direction and theres a residual capacity of that theres a residual capacity of that theres a residual capacity of that can be used and here there is an
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,32:58,33:03,can be used and here there is an can be used and here there is an additional units of flow capacity additional units of flow capacity additional units of flow capacity that we can still use ok so this is the that we can still use ok so this is the
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,33:03,33:09,that we can still use ok so this is the residual graph so this if we call as the residual graph so this if we call as the residual graph so this if we call as the graph g and this is the residual graph graph g and this is the residual graph
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,33:09,33:27,graph g and this is the residual graph for the flow f ok so f was routing for the flow f ok so f was routing for the flow f ok so f was routing through and through and through and through and through and through and through ok so corresponding to that
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,33:27,33:34,through ok so corresponding to that through ok so corresponding to that flow we get this particular residual flow we get this particular residual flow we get this particular residual graph now look at the residual graph in graph now look at the residual graph in graph now look at the residual graph in the residual graph there are many paths
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,33:34,33:42,the residual graph there are many paths the residual graph there are many paths from let us say i mean to and those from let us say i mean to and those from let us say i mean to and those residual paths can be used to route residual paths can be used to route
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,33:42,33:58,residual paths can be used to route additional flow for example you could additional flow for example you could additional flow for example you could take the and and take the and and take the and and you could route an additional units you could route an additional units you could route an additional units okay once you do that the flow changes
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,33:58,34:11,okay once you do that the flow changes okay once you do that the flow changes music okay so in that case the already okay so in that case the already existing flow of units was there now existing flow of units was there now existing flow of units was there now we are routing an additional ten units
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,34:11,34:18,we are routing an additional ten units we are routing an additional ten units okay so the new flow becomes so lets okay so the new flow becomes so lets okay so the new flow becomes so lets call this is f prime this is equal to if call this is f prime this is equal to if
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,34:18,34:33,call this is f prime this is equal to if you think of it as a function twenty you think of it as a function twenty you think of it as a function twenty units from to units from to units from to units from to units from to units from to and units from to was already
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,34:33,34:45,and units from to was already and units from to was already existing and from to and from existing and from to and from existing and from to and from to this we are routing in the to this we are routing in the to this we are routing in the residual graph but we want a flow in the
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,34:45,34:51,residual graph but we want a flow in the residual graph but we want a flow in the original graph so routing it from to original graph so routing it from to original graph so routing it from to is essentially amounting to decreasing is essentially amounting to decreasing is essentially amounting to decreasing the flow because here we are using the
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,34:51,34:57,the flow because here we are using the the flow because here we are using the back edge was a forward edge back edge was a forward edge back edge was a forward edge was a back edge and on that back edge if was a back edge and on that back edge if
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,34:57,35:05,was a back edge and on that back edge if you are sending that means were you are sending that means were you are sending that means were decrementing the original flow so i will decrementing the original flow so i will decrementing the original flow so i will just write it as minus from to
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,35:05,35:15,just write it as minus from to just write it as minus from to and from to okay so now the new and from to okay so now the new and from to okay so now the new network would essentially be the new network would essentially be the new
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,35:15,35:38,network would essentially be the new flow or the new network the new flow flow or the new network the new flow flow or the new network the new flow would be from to and from to would be from to and from to would be from to and from to to from to
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,35:38,35:53,and twenty from three to four okay so and twenty from three to four okay so this is taking that off yeah so these this is taking that off yeah so these this is taking that off yeah so these two combine and gets us ten from two to two combine and gets us ten from two to
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,35:53,36:01,two combine and gets us ten from two to three okay so this is that new flow that three okay so this is that new flow that three okay so this is that new flow that we can this is an additional flow of ten we can this is an additional flow of ten
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,36:01,36:11,we can this is an additional flow of ten units that we can get by looking at the units that we can get by looking at the units that we can get by looking at the residual graph now corresponding to this residual graph now corresponding to this residual graph now corresponding to this new flow f prime we can again compute
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,36:11,36:25,new flow f prime we can again compute new flow f prime we can again compute the residual graph that will essentially the residual graph that will essentially the residual graph that will essentially be of the following form from one to two okay so one to two there was a flow of
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,36:25,36:39,okay so one to two there was a flow of okay so there is still a bad flow okay so there is still a bad flow okay so there is still a bad flow possible of value and forward there possible of value and forward there possible of value and forward there is still a residual capacity of and
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,36:39,36:58,is still a residual capacity of and is still a residual capacity of and to we had missed one particular edge to we had missed one particular edge to we had missed one particular edge namely from to from to namely from to from to namely from to from to and we had some flow of from from
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,36:58,37:15,and we had some flow of from from and we had some flow of from from to okay so that will be the changed flow so okay so that will be the changed flow so there will be a backflow of size there will be a backflow of size there will be a backflow of size there is no forward capacity and one two
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,37:15,37:21,there is no forward capacity and one two there is no forward capacity and one two three theres going to be a backward three theres going to be a backward three theres going to be a backward edge of capacity ten and from two to edge of capacity ten and from two to
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,37:21,37:27,edge of capacity ten and from two to three there was a capacity of that is three there was a capacity of that is three there was a capacity of that is used so you can have ten in the forward used so you can have ten in the forward
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,37:27,37:36,used so you can have ten in the forward direction and ten in the backward direction and ten in the backward direction and ten in the backward direction and three to four there was direction and three to four there was direction and three to four there was units used so theres a units
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,37:36,37:46,units used so theres a units units used so theres a units backflow and ten units in the forward backflow and ten units in the forward backflow and ten units in the forward direction okay so this is the residual direction okay so this is the residual direction okay so this is the residual graph corresponding to the new flow okay
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,37:46,37:51,graph corresponding to the new flow okay graph corresponding to the new flow okay and if you look at this particular and if you look at this particular and if you look at this particular residual graph what you can see is its residual graph what you can see is its
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,37:51,37:59,residual graph what you can see is its still possible to route another ten still possible to route another ten still possible to route another ten units of flow okay so that means theres units of flow okay so that means theres units of flow okay so that means theres a path from one to two to three to four
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,37:59,38:15,a path from one to two to three to four a path from one to two to three to four and you can route a flow of ten units and you can route a flow of ten units and you can route a flow of ten units along this path and that would give rise
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,38:15,38:24,along this path and that would give rise along this path and that would give rise to a new flow okay and that flow to a new flow okay and that flow to a new flow okay and that flow essentially will be as follows so ten essentially will be as follows so ten
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,38:24,38:36,essentially will be as follows so ten units from one to two this is augmenting units from one to two this is augmenting units from one to two this is augmenting the already existing twenty units of the already existing twenty units of the already existing twenty units of flow so you can say from to and
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,38:36,38:44,from to there is already a flow of from to there is already a flow of we are increasing so this was a we are increasing so this was a we are increasing so this was a units of flow that was already there units of flow that was already there
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,38:44,38:54,units of flow that was already there from to in the original graph and we from to in the original graph and we from to in the original graph and we are using this particular edge to route are using this particular edge to route are using this particular edge to route an additional so that would amount to
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,38:54,39:03,an additional so that would amount to an additional so that would amount to from to okay and to is the from to okay and to is the from to okay and to is the other one that is affected there was a other one that is affected there was a
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,39:03,39:16,other one that is affected there was a flow of from to we are increasing flow of from to we are increasing flow of from to we are increasing it by so from three to four and the other edges they three to four and the other edges they remain untouched ten from one to three
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,39:16,39:22,remain untouched ten from one to three remain untouched ten from one to three that is going to be remaining as such that is going to be remaining as such that is going to be remaining as such and ten from two to four was also in to and ten from two to four was also in to
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,39:22,39:30,and ten from two to four was also in to remain as such okay so now if you look remain as such okay so now if you look remain as such okay so now if you look at the original graph this is a valid at the original graph this is a valid
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,39:30,39:36,at the original graph this is a valid flow in the original graph and flow in the original graph and flow in the original graph and corresponding to this so let us call corresponding to this so let us call corresponding to this so let us call this as f doubleprime if you compute
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,39:36,39:45,this as f doubleprime if you compute this as f doubleprime if you compute the residual graph that will be as the residual graph that will be as the residual graph that will be as follows lets look at edge that is follows lets look at edge that is follows lets look at edge that is already a flow of ok one two two
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,39:45,39:49,already a flow of ok one two two already a flow of ok one two two there is a flow of and thats a there is a flow of and thats a there is a flow of and thats a maximum possible and therefore there is maximum possible and therefore there is
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,39:49,40:00,maximum possible and therefore there is no residual capacity the only thing that no residual capacity the only thing that no residual capacity the only thing that will remain is a back edge of capacity will remain is a back edge of capacity will remain is a back edge of capacity and from to there is a flow of
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,40:00,40:05,and from to there is a flow of and from to there is a flow of and that it is also saturated so only and that it is also saturated so only and that it is also saturated so only thing that will remain as a single back thing that will remain as a single back
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,40:05,40:19,thing that will remain as a single back edge of size and is also to edge of size and is also to edge of size and is also to this so thats also saturated so you this so thats also saturated so you this so thats also saturated so you will have a back edge of capacity and
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,40:19,40:29,that is also saturated and there that is also saturated and there will be a back edge of capacity and will be a back edge of capacity and will be a back edge of capacity and to there is a flow of so thats to there is a flow of so thats
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,40:29,40:37,to there is a flow of so thats also saturated you will get units also saturated you will get units also saturated you will get units okay now if you look at this residual okay now if you look at this residual okay now if you look at this residual graph g f doubleprime we will see that
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,40:37,40:45,graph g f doubleprime we will see that graph g f doubleprime we will see that there are no paths from s to t okay and there are no paths from s to t okay and there are no paths from s to t okay and therefore its not at least in this
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,40:45,40:54,therefore its not at least in this therefore its not at least in this situation it doesnt look that we can situation it doesnt look that we can situation it doesnt look that we can really increase the flow any further we really increase the flow any further we really increase the flow any further we will prove that as a mathematical
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,40:54,41:02,will prove that as a mathematical will prove that as a mathematical theorem in particular if you have a theorem in particular if you have a theorem in particular if you have a particular flow ok so you take any particular flow ok so you take any particular flow ok so you take any arbitrary flow corresponding to that
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,41:02,41:13,arbitrary flow corresponding to that arbitrary flow corresponding to that flow we can compute whatever is known as flow we can compute whatever is known as flow we can compute whatever is known as its residual graph and if the residual its residual graph and if the residual its residual graph and if the residual graph doesnt have any path from s to t
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,41:13,41:21,graph doesnt have any path from s to t graph doesnt have any path from s to t then we will show that there is a cut then we will show that there is a cut then we will show that there is a cut which is saturated ok lets write this
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,41:21,41:48,which is saturated ok lets write this which is saturated ok lets write this down down down if f is a flow such that the residual if f is a flow such that the residual if f is a flow such that the residual graph gf doesnt contain any path from s
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,41:48,42:02,graph gf doesnt contain any path from s graph gf doesnt contain any path from s to t then f is a max flow thats what we to t then f is a max flow thats what we to t then f is a max flow thats what we will prove in order to show that f is a
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,42:02,42:17,will prove in order to show that f is a will prove in order to show that f is a max flow what we will prove is there max flow what we will prove is there max flow what we will prove is there exist a cut a b in g such that value of
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,42:17,42:26,exist a cut a b in g such that value of exist a cut a b in g such that value of f is going to be equal to the capacity f is going to be equal to the capacity f is going to be equal to the capacity of this cut a b when the value of this
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,42:26,42:30,of this cut a b when the value of this of this cut a b when the value of this flow is equal to the capacity of a b it flow is equal to the capacity of a b it flow is equal to the capacity of a b it is impossible to increase the value of
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,42:30,42:38,is impossible to increase the value of is impossible to increase the value of if there is any other flow whose values if there is any other flow whose values if there is any other flow whose values so if g was another flow says that value so if g was another flow says that value
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,42:38,42:42,so if g was another flow says that value of g is greater than value of f and not of g is greater than value of f and not of g is greater than value of f and not automatically value of g will be greater automatically value of g will be greater
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,42:42,42:51,automatically value of g will be greater than ca b okay but we have argued than ca b okay but we have argued than ca b okay but we have argued earlier that value of g can be at most earlier that value of g can be at most earlier that value of g can be at most ca b so if we show that there exists a
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,42:51,43:00,ca b so if we show that there exists a ca b so if we show that there exists a cut whose capacity is equal to the value cut whose capacity is equal to the value cut whose capacity is equal to the value of the flow then we have enough reason
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,43:00,43:04,of the flow then we have enough reason of the flow then we have enough reason to conclude that that flow that we have to conclude that that flow that we have to conclude that that flow that we have found is a max flow so lets formally found is a max flow so lets formally
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,43:04,43:30,found is a max flow so lets formally define what is gf the residual graph so f is any particular flow okay the so f is any particular flow okay the vertex set v f will be equal to v the vertex set v f will be equal to v the
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,43:30,43:37,vertex set v f will be equal to v the vertex sets are the same the edges we vertex sets are the same the edges we vertex sets are the same the edges we are going to have additional edges and are going to have additional edges and are going to have additional edges and the capacity of the edges that are also
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,43:37,43:52,the capacity of the edges that are also the capacity of the edges that are also going to be changing so for every flow going to be changing so for every flow going to be changing so for every flow carrying add a comma b okay so this is carrying add a comma b okay so this is
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,43:52,44:00,carrying add a comma b okay so this is some particular edge a comma b and if it some particular edge a comma b and if it some particular edge a comma b and if it carries a flow fe okay carries a flow fe okay carries a flow fe okay then we will have two edges okay first
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,44:00,44:11,then we will have two edges okay first then we will have two edges okay first is a forward edge so forwarded will be is a forward edge so forwarded will be is a forward edge so forwarded will be from a to b and its capacity will be from a to b and its capacity will be
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,44:11,44:28,from a to b and its capacity will be capacity of the original edge whatever capacity of the original edge whatever capacity of the original edge whatever is a current flow and the backward edge will be b comma a and its capacity will will be b comma a and its capacity will be equal to f e whatever was the flow
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,44:28,44:32,be equal to f e whatever was the flow be equal to f e whatever was the flow thats going to be the capacity okay thats going to be the capacity okay thats going to be the capacity okay so this is how the residual graph is so this is how the residual graph is
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,44:32,44:40,so this is how the residual graph is defined vertices are the same as the defined vertices are the same as the defined vertices are the same as the original graphs if a particular edge is original graphs if a particular edge is original graphs if a particular edge is carrying a flow of value fe then you
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,44:40,44:46,carrying a flow of value fe then you carrying a flow of value fe then you have forward edge whose capacity is have forward edge whose capacity is have forward edge whose capacity is bounded by the difference of the bounded by the difference of the bounded by the difference of the existing flow and the maximum capacity
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,44:46,44:50,existing flow and the maximum capacity existing flow and the maximum capacity and there will be a back edge whose and there will be a back edge whose and there will be a back edge whose capacity would be equal to whatever is capacity would be equal to whatever is
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,44:50,44:56,capacity would be equal to whatever is the value of the flow okay so this is the value of the flow okay so this is the value of the flow okay so this is the formal definition of the residual the formal definition of the residual the formal definition of the residual graph and now what we need to show is
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,44:56,45:04,graph and now what we need to show is graph and now what we need to show is that if the residual graph doesnt have that if the residual graph doesnt have that if the residual graph doesnt have any st connection if it doesnt contain any st connection if it doesnt contain
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,45:04,45:10,any st connection if it doesnt contain a path from s to t then we can find a a path from s to t then we can find a a path from s to t then we can find a cut which is saturated by this cut which is saturated by this
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,45:10,45:23,cut which is saturated by this particular flow okay so we will define particular flow okay so we will define particular flow okay so we will define the cut okay so let f be a flow such the cut okay so let f be a flow such the cut okay so let f be a flow such that
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,45:23,45:49,there exists no st paths in gf okay so there exists no st paths in gf okay so now let a be the vertices reachable from now let a be the vertices reachable from now let a be the vertices reachable from s in gf okay so in the residual graph
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,45:49,45:53,s in gf okay so in the residual graph s in gf okay so in the residual graph look at all the vertices reachable from look at all the vertices reachable from look at all the vertices reachable from s clearly since st path is not there it s clearly since st path is not there it
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,45:53,46:01,s clearly since st path is not there it doesnt contain t and the cut is doesnt contain t and the cut is doesnt contain t and the cut is consistent of this a and its complement consistent of this a and its complement consistent of this a and its complement okay so the cut that we have well call
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,46:01,46:09,okay so the cut that we have well call okay so the cut that we have well call it as let us say lets call this a star it as let us say lets call this a star it as let us say lets call this a star so cut a star b star is defined in the
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,46:09,46:18,so cut a star b star is defined in the so cut a star b star is defined in the following way following way following way vertices reachable from s in gf forms a vertices reachable from s in gf forms a vertices reachable from s in gf forms a star and not reachable from s or the
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,46:18,46:27,star and not reachable from s or the star and not reachable from s or the remaining vertices forms b star okay our remaining vertices forms b star okay our remaining vertices forms b star okay our claim is the value of this cut a star b claim is the value of this cut a star b
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,46:27,46:34,claim is the value of this cut a star b star is equal to the capacity of this star is equal to the capacity of this star is equal to the capacity of this cut is equal to value of the flow okay cut is equal to value of the flow okay
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,46:34,46:40,cut is equal to value of the flow okay how do we prove this okay so lets look how do we prove this okay so lets look how do we prove this okay so lets look at these vertices this is a star and at these vertices this is a star and
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,46:40,46:47,at these vertices this is a star and what excess is sitting somewhere inside what excess is sitting somewhere inside what excess is sitting somewhere inside that and then there is b star which are that and then there is b star which are that and then there is b star which are the unreachable vertices and t is
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,46:47,46:53,the unreachable vertices and t is the unreachable vertices and t is sitting somewhere inside okay and of sitting somewhere inside okay and of sitting somewhere inside okay and of course there are these edges which go course there are these edges which go course there are these edges which go from a to b and there it is from b to a
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,46:53,47:02,from a to b and there it is from b to a from a to b and there it is from b to a as well the value of the flow we have as well the value of the flow we have as well the value of the flow we have argued so v f we can say is equal to the
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,47:02,47:14,argued so v f we can say is equal to the argued so v f we can say is equal to the red edges blue edges okay the flow red edges blue edges okay the flow red edges blue edges okay the flow through the red dead just minus the flow
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,47:14,47:24,through the red dead just minus the flow through the red dead just minus the flow through the blue edges what we will through the blue edges what we will through the blue edges what we will argue is that the flow through red edges argue is that the flow through red edges
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,47:24,47:33,argue is that the flow through red edges is equal to capacity of the red edges is equal to capacity of the red edges is equal to capacity of the red edges and flow through the blue edges is equal and flow through the blue edges is equal and flow through the blue edges is equal to zero okay so this is a cut which is
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,47:33,47:38,to zero okay so this is a cut which is to zero okay so this is a cut which is saturated so if you look at the saturated so if you look at the saturated so if you look at the forwarded doesnt the forwarded doesnt the forwarded doesnt the they are they have all been saturated
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,47:38,47:43,they are they have all been saturated they are they have all been saturated and so this is going to be the maximum and so this is going to be the maximum and so this is going to be the maximum possible flow okay so if we prove these possible flow okay so if we prove these
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,47:43,47:51,possible flow okay so if we prove these two statements our conclusion follows two statements our conclusion follows two statements our conclusion follows because value of the flow was flow because value of the flow was flow because value of the flow was flow through the red edges flow through the
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,47:51,47:57,through the red edges flow through the through the red edges flow through the blue edges and if you show that the blue edges and if you show that the blue edges and if you show that the value of the flow is equal to c a b in value of the flow is equal to c a b in
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,47:57,48:00,value of the flow is equal to c a b in order to show that we just need to show order to show that we just need to show order to show that we just need to show that right at the red edges are that right at the red edges are
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,48:00,48:06,that right at the red edges are operating at full capacity and the blue operating at full capacity and the blue operating at full capacity and the blue edges are operating at zero capacity edges are operating at zero capacity edges are operating at zero capacity okay so now lets show that the red
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,48:06,48:12,okay so now lets show that the red okay so now lets show that the red edges are operating at the full capacity edges are operating at the full capacity edges are operating at the full capacity its straightforward because suppose its straightforward because suppose its straightforward because suppose there was a red edge which is operating
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,48:12,48:18,there was a red edge which is operating there was a red edge which is operating at capacity less than c okay so let us at capacity less than c okay so let us at capacity less than c okay so let us say this edge has capacity c e and the
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,48:18,48:24,say this edge has capacity c e and the say this edge has capacity c e and the flow was anything less than fe okay that flow was anything less than fe okay that flow was anything less than fe okay that would mean that in the residual graph would mean that in the residual graph
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,48:24,48:30,would mean that in the residual graph there is a forward edge from a star to b there is a forward edge from a star to b there is a forward edge from a star to b star with capacity so there is going to star with capacity so there is going to
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,48:30,48:36,star with capacity so there is going to be some edge from this part to this part be some edge from this part to this part be some edge from this part to this part whose capacity is c e minus fe and that whose capacity is c e minus fe and that
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,48:36,48:45,whose capacity is c e minus fe and that would make this particular vertex over would make this particular vertex over would make this particular vertex over here and b star come to a star but we here and b star come to a star but we here and b star come to a star but we argued that b star are all the
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,48:45,48:52,argued that b star are all the argued that b star are all the unreachable vertices and therefore there unreachable vertices and therefore there unreachable vertices and therefore there cannot be a forward edges so therefore cannot be a forward edges so therefore cannot be a forward edges so therefore every edge from a to b is operating at
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,48:52,48:59,every edge from a to b is operating at every edge from a to b is operating at its full capacity so this part is done its full capacity so this part is done its full capacity so this part is done for the second part if any of these
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,48:59,49:04,for the second part if any of these for the second part if any of these edges was carrying some particular edges was carrying some particular edges was carrying some particular capacity if the blue edge had some capacity if the blue edge had some capacity if the blue edge had some capacity is had some flow through it
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,49:04,49:10,capacity is had some flow through it capacity is had some flow through it okay some nonzero amount let us say this okay some nonzero amount let us say this okay some nonzero amount let us say this has a flow of alpha then in the residual has a flow of alpha then in the residual
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,49:10,49:19,has a flow of alpha then in the residual graph there is going to be back edge graph there is going to be back edge graph there is going to be back edge from here to here with the same capacity from here to here with the same capacity from here to here with the same capacity alpha and that would make this
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,49:19,49:25,alpha and that would make this alpha and that would make this particular vertex here and be reachable particular vertex here and be reachable particular vertex here and be reachable but weve argued that b star in our but weve argued that b star in our but weve argued that b star in our definition said b star was all the
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,49:25,49:32,definition said b star was all the definition said b star was all the unreachable vertices and therefore there unreachable vertices and therefore there unreachable vertices and therefore there cannot be any such edge going from a cannot be any such edge going from a cannot be any such edge going from a star to b star okay so in particular
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,49:32,49:35,star to b star okay so in particular star to b star okay so in particular that would mean that the value of the that would mean that the value of the that would mean that the value of the flow through the blue edge should be flow through the blue edge should be
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,49:35,49:43,flow through the blue edge should be zero and therefore now we have found a zero and therefore now we have found a zero and therefore now we have found a particular cut and if there is no path particular cut and if there is no path particular cut and if there is no path from s to t in the residual graph then
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,49:43,49:48,from s to t in the residual graph then from s to t in the residual graph then using that information we can compute a using that information we can compute a using that information we can compute a cut in the original graph and argue that cut in the original graph and argue that
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,49:48,49:55,cut in the original graph and argue that that cut that cut that cut capacity is reached by this particular capacity is reached by this particular capacity is reached by this particular flow okay so since we have found a flow flow okay so since we have found a flow
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,49:55,50:02,flow okay so since we have found a flow which matches the value of the cut we which matches the value of the cut we which matches the value of the cut we know that thats going to be the maximum know that thats going to be the maximum know that thats going to be the maximum flow and that basically is the proof of
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,50:02,50:24,flow and that basically is the proof of flow and that basically is the proof of maxflow mincut theorem the value of the maximum flow will be the value of the maximum flow will be equal to the capacity of the mincut equal to the capacity of the mincut equal to the capacity of the mincut okay one direction wed already proven
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,50:24,50:32,okay one direction wed already proven okay one direction wed already proven and this basically says that if the and this basically says that if the and this basically says that if the residual graph doesnt have a path residual graph doesnt have a path residual graph doesnt have a path theres no way we can increase the flow
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,50:32,50:37,theres no way we can increase the flow theres no way we can increase the flow any further so if we have taken an any further so if we have taken an any further so if we have taken an arbitrary graph and computed the arbitrary graph and computed the
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,50:37,50:43,arbitrary graph and computed the residual graph and kept on doing that residual graph and kept on doing that residual graph and kept on doing that until we can do so the flow keeps on until we can do so the flow keeps on until we can do so the flow keeps on increasing and it should mean if you
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,50:43,50:48,increasing and it should mean if you increasing and it should mean if you assume that the weights are all integers assume that the weights are all integers assume that the weights are all integers then at some point the process must stop then at some point the process must stop
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,50:48,50:54,then at some point the process must stop and when the process stops we know that and when the process stops we know that and when the process stops we know that there are no st paths and when there there are no st paths and when there there are no st paths and when there are no st paths there is a cut which
216.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,50:54,51:02,are no st paths there is a cut which are no st paths there is a cut which has been saturated so thats basically has been saturated so thats basically has been saturated so thats basically the proof of maxflow mincut theorem
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,0:09,0:35,music music you music music you in todays lecture we will learn about in todays lecture we will learn about counting the spanning trees of the counting the spanning trees of the counting the spanning trees of the complete graph so lets understand what complete graph so lets understand what
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,0:35,1:03,complete graph so lets understand what this means so we have talked about this means so we have talked about this means so we have talked about spanning trees before so suppose g is a spanning trees before so suppose g is a spanning trees before so suppose g is a graph spanning tree t
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,1:03,1:28,should satisfy two conditions the first should satisfy two conditions the first condition being t should be connected and the second condition is t should be and the second condition is t should be slightly free okay so it is basically a slightly free okay so it is basically a
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,1:28,1:36,slightly free okay so it is basically a tree such that every vertex there is a tree such that every vertex there is a tree such that every vertex there is a path from every vertex to every other path from every vertex to every other path from every vertex to every other vertex so you can say that it is the
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,1:36,1:45,vertex so you can say that it is the vertex so you can say that it is the minimal such graph minimal in the sense minimal such graph minimal in the sense minimal such graph minimal in the sense of number of edges required so this is a of number of edges required so this is a
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,1:45,1:52,of number of edges required so this is a definition of a spanning tree and we are definition of a spanning tree and we are definition of a spanning tree and we are looking at the complete graph on n looking at the complete graph on n looking at the complete graph on n vertices so let us say if we had taken
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,1:52,2:01,vertices so let us say if we had taken vertices so let us say if we had taken three vertices this would be the three vertices this would be the three vertices this would be the complete graph on three vertices which complete graph on three vertices which complete graph on three vertices which we represent by k and if we number the
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,2:01,2:09,we represent by k and if we number the we represent by k and if we number the vertices as this graph has many vertices as this graph has many vertices as this graph has many spanning trees in particular if we just spanning trees in particular if we just
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,2:09,2:26,spanning trees in particular if we just try to draw every spanning tree of this try to draw every spanning tree of this try to draw every spanning tree of this graph will have exactly two edges so graph will have exactly two edges so graph will have exactly two edges so is one possibility so this is t
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,2:26,2:38,is one possibility so this is t is one possibility so this is t will be the second spanning tree will be the second spanning tree will be the second spanning tree and that is yet another spanning tree and that is yet another spanning tree and that is yet another spanning tree which is which consists of the edges
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,2:38,2:46,which is which consists of the edges which is which consists of the edges amp so you can verify that these amp so you can verify that these amp so you can verify that these are the only spanning trees for k so are the only spanning trees for k so
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,2:46,3:06,are the only spanning trees for k so when k equals the number will be if when k equals the number will be if when k equals the number will be if we had looked at the simpler example of we had looked at the simpler example of we had looked at the simpler example of k which is precisely spanning tree
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,3:06,3:15,so you can say for n equals two the so you can say for n equals two the values one for n equals three lets see values one for n equals three lets see values one for n equals three lets see what is the case when n is equal to four
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,3:15,3:22,what is the case when n is equal to four what is the case when n is equal to four so were looking at this particular so were looking at this particular so were looking at this particular graph the complete graph and for what is graph the complete graph and for what is
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,3:22,3:36,graph the complete graph and for what is this how many spanning trees does this this how many spanning trees does this this how many spanning trees does this particular graph so we can enumerate particular graph so we can enumerate particular graph so we can enumerate them so one would be of this kind where
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,3:36,3:43,them so one would be of this kind where them so one would be of this kind where so all the spanning trees of kfor so all the spanning trees of kfor so all the spanning trees of kfor will have precisely three edges so the will have precisely three edges so the
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,3:43,3:52,will have precisely three edges so the ones which consists of the boundaries is ones which consists of the boundaries is ones which consists of the boundaries is a square there will be three of them so a square there will be three of them so a square there will be three of them so there is a missing edge here and there
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,3:52,3:59,there is a missing edge here and there there is a missing edge here and there are four ways you could choose them so are four ways you could choose them so are four ways you could choose them so there are four trees of this kind and if there are four trees of this kind and if
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,3:59,4:11,there are four trees of this kind and if you include the diagonal okay so you can you include the diagonal okay so you can you include the diagonal okay so you can include like both diagonal okay so these include like both diagonal okay so these include like both diagonal okay so these four are without including diagonal now
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,4:11,4:18,four are without including diagonal now four are without including diagonal now the choice becomes do you include two the choice becomes do you include two the choice becomes do you include two diagonals that include only one diagonal diagonals that include only one diagonal diagonals that include only one diagonal okay so lets just look at including two
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,4:18,4:24,okay so lets just look at including two okay so lets just look at including two diagonals so these are the two edges and diagonals so these are the two edges and diagonals so these are the two edges and the third edge that you want to add the third edge that you want to add
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,4:24,4:31,the third edge that you want to add could be any of the other four okay could be any of the other four okay could be any of the other four okay because each of them so if you had taken because each of them so if you had taken
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,4:31,4:37,because each of them so if you had taken this that will give you a spanning tree this that will give you a spanning tree this that will give you a spanning tree and so all those four choices would give and so all those four choices would give and so all those four choices would give you valid spanning trees so there are
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,4:37,4:44,you valid spanning trees so there are you valid spanning trees so there are four trees of that kind and if you four trees of that kind and if you four trees of that kind and if you choose to include just one diagonal okay choose to include just one diagonal okay
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,4:44,4:48,choose to include just one diagonal okay so let us say if we are using the one so let us say if we are using the one so let us say if we are using the one for diagonal the other case would be for diagonal the other case would be
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,4:48,5:12,for diagonal the other case would be symmetric now we can choose either these symmetric now we can choose either these symmetric now we can choose either these two this is yet another case so these are the four spanning trees so these are the four spanning trees that we will get if we choose to add the

217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,6:46,6:51,know is the number of spanning trees of know is the number of spanning trees of k n so we are looking at labeling k n k n so we are looking at labeling k n k n so we are looking at labeling k n okay so these are and after we have
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,6:51,6:54,okay so these are and after we have okay so these are and after we have obtained the label in how many distinct obtained the label in how many distinct obtained the label in how many distinct spanning trees are there thats what we spanning trees are there thats what we
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,6:54,7:07,spanning trees are there thats what we want to count the number of spanning want to count the number of spanning want to count the number of spanning trees of k n is equal to n raise to n trees of k n is equal to n raise to n
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,7:07,7:11,trees of k n is equal to n raise to n minus this is the theorem that we minus this is the theorem that we minus this is the theorem that we would prove so our counters n raise to n would prove so our counters n raise to n
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,7:11,7:23,would prove so our counters n raise to n minus we can verify that when minus we can verify that when minus we can verify that when and this two three and four so to raise and this two three and four so to raise and this two three and four so to raise to two minus two thats going to be
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,7:23,7:30,to two minus two thats going to be to two minus two thats going to be raise to minus is going to be raise to minus is going to be raise to minus is going to be raise to minus is going to be raise to minus is going to be
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,7:30,7:38,raise to minus is going to be okay so all those cases we have verified okay so all those cases we have verified okay so all those cases we have verified we need to prove this in the general we need to prove this in the general we need to prove this in the general case and while proving this we will use
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,7:38,7:49,case and while proving this we will use case and while proving this we will use an interesting technique we will an interesting technique we will an interesting technique we will basically set up an isomorphism between basically set up an isomorphism between basically set up an isomorphism between two sets so lets look at this problem
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,7:49,7:54,two sets so lets look at this problem two sets so lets look at this problem youve given a particular set s and you youve given a particular set s and you youve given a particular set s and you want to count the number of elements in want to count the number of elements in
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,7:54,8:02,want to count the number of elements in it one way to count is to explicitly it one way to count is to explicitly it one way to count is to explicitly count the number of i mean enumerate the count the number of i mean enumerate the count the number of i mean enumerate the elements in s and then see what is its
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,8:02,8:12,elements in s and then see what is its elements in s and then see what is its count another way could be to set up a count another way could be to set up a count another way could be to set up a correspondence ok so you can set up a
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,8:12,8:18,correspondence ok so you can set up a correspondence ok so you can set up a correspondence with another set which is correspondence with another set which is correspondence with another set which is easier to count ok so this we can think easier to count ok so this we can think
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,8:18,8:25,easier to count ok so this we can think of us and easier to count set if we can of us and easier to count set if we can of us and easier to count set if we can find an isomorphism which maps every find an isomorphism which maps every
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,8:25,8:34,find an isomorphism which maps every element to a unique element in the other element to a unique element in the other element to a unique element in the other collection ok in such a way that every collection ok in such a way that every collection ok in such a way that every element of the other set is occurring as
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,8:34,8:38,element of the other set is occurring as element of the other set is occurring as the image of at least one of the the image of at least one of the the image of at least one of the elements if we can set up a bijection elements if we can set up a bijection
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,8:38,8:49,elements if we can set up a bijection between these two sets then we know that between these two sets then we know that between these two sets then we know that the counts are going to agree so there the counts are going to agree so there the counts are going to agree so there are many natural objects whose count is
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,8:49,8:56,are many natural objects whose count is are many natural objects whose count is n raise to n minus we will show that n raise to n minus we will show that n raise to n minus we will show that the spanning trees can be put in by the spanning trees can be put in by
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,8:56,9:05,the spanning trees can be put in by diction to one of those sets so one diction to one of those sets so one diction to one of those sets so one natural candidate for a set having n natural candidate for a set having n natural candidate for a set having n raise to n minus two elements would be
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,9:05,9:23,raise to n minus two elements would be raise to n minus two elements would be if you consider lists well think of if you consider lists well think of if you consider lists well think of this as an ordered lists of size n minus this as an ordered lists of size n minus
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,9:23,9:44,this as an ordered lists of size n minus  from said s consisting of n objects okay from said s consisting of n objects okay from said s consisting of n objects okay so we have a set let us call this set as so we have a set let us call this set as
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,9:44,9:55,so we have a set let us call this set as s now this set has n objects and we are s now this set has n objects and we are s now this set has n objects and we are allowed to form lists of these and the allowed to form lists of these and the
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,9:55,10:03,allowed to form lists of these and the length of these lists is n minus the length of these lists is n minus the length of these lists is n minus the first element of course can be chosen in first element of course can be chosen in first element of course can be chosen in n ways and we are allowing repetitions
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,10:03,10:11,n ways and we are allowing repetitions n ways and we are allowing repetitions the second element also as n the second element also as n the second element also as n possibilities the n minus element can possibilities the n minus element can possibilities the n minus element can also have n possibility so they multiply
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,10:11,10:17,also have n possibility so they multiply also have n possibility so they multiply and therefore the total number of ways and therefore the total number of ways and therefore the total number of ways of having these lists clearly is n raise of having these lists clearly is n raise
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,10:17,10:24,of having these lists clearly is n raise to n minus so this is one of the to n minus so this is one of the to n minus so this is one of the quantities that we have now we have this quantities that we have now we have this
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,10:24,10:30,quantities that we have now we have this collection of the set our main set that collection of the set our main set that collection of the set our main set that we are interested in lets call it as t we are interested in lets call it as t
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,10:30,10:36,we are interested in lets call it as t t consists of all the spanning trees of t consists of all the spanning trees of t consists of all the spanning trees of k n okay so if you are able to find a k n okay so if you are able to find a
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,10:36,10:46,k n okay so if you are able to find a bisection such that each such list bisection such that each such list bisection such that each such list corresponds to one unique element of the corresponds to one unique element of the corresponds to one unique element of the set of spanning trees then what we know
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,10:46,10:52,set of spanning trees then what we know set of spanning trees then what we know is that the counts match and this by is that the counts match and this by is that the counts match and this by diction is basically known as the diction is basically known as the
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,10:52,11:08,diction is basically known as the proofer coding so let us see what is proofer coding so let us see what is proofer coding so let us see what is this by direction the by diction will be this by direction the by diction will be this by direction the by diction will be given by our means of an algorithm
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,11:08,11:28,so we will assume that we are given a so we will assume that we are given a tree so input is a tree whose vertices tree so input is a tree whose vertices tree so input is a tree whose vertices are from the set s and we are going to
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,11:28,11:34,are from the set s and we are going to are from the set s and we are going to assume that the set s is an ordered set assume that the set s is an ordered set assume that the set s is an ordered set in this in the sense given two elements
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,11:34,11:37,in this in the sense given two elements in this in the sense given two elements will set we can say which is the larger will set we can say which is the larger will set we can say which is the larger element which is a smaller element and
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,11:37,11:45,element which is a smaller element and element which is a smaller element and so on okay so on okay so on okay so well assume that there is a total so well assume that there is a total so well assume that there is a total order on the set s and the output will
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,11:45,12:10,order on the set s and the output will order on the set s and the output will be a sequence of length n minus or a be a sequence of length n minus or a be a sequence of length n minus or a list of n minus elements
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,12:10,12:18,so proofer coding basically when given so proofer coding basically when given an input tree it will produce an output an input tree it will produce an output an input tree it will produce an output sequence what we will need to show is sequence what we will need to show is
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,12:18,12:28,sequence what we will need to show is that every sequence will be generated by that every sequence will be generated by that every sequence will be generated by precisely one tree when we look at this precisely one tree when we look at this precisely one tree when we look at this encoding when we look at the algorithm
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,12:28,12:32,encoding when we look at the algorithm encoding when we look at the algorithm for encoding we can see that if you are for encoding we can see that if you are for encoding we can see that if you are given a tree theres only a unique given a tree theres only a unique
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,12:32,12:40,given a tree theres only a unique sequence that can be produced the sequence that can be produced the sequence that can be produced the sequence produce will be unique but what sequence produce will be unique but what sequence produce will be unique but what we will argue is that for every sequence
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,12:40,12:45,we will argue is that for every sequence we will argue is that for every sequence there is a tree which generates that as there is a tree which generates that as there is a tree which generates that as well and there is precisely one tree well and there is precisely one tree
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,12:45,12:52,well and there is precisely one tree which will generate that so lets see which will generate that so lets see which will generate that so lets see what encoding is so the proof for code what encoding is so the proof for code what encoding is so the proof for code is generated in an algorithmic fashion
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,12:52,13:01,is generated in an algorithmic fashion is generated in an algorithmic fashion so this is the iterative step okay so we so this is the iterative step okay so we so this is the iterative step okay so we will repeatedly do this iterative step will repeatedly do this iterative step
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,13:01,13:20,will repeatedly do this iterative step for n minus steps what we do is pick for n minus steps what we do is pick for n minus steps what we do is pick the least valued leaf node so youve the least valued leaf node so youve the least valued leaf node so youve given a tree so the tree must surely
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,13:20,13:25,given a tree so the tree must surely given a tree so the tree must surely have some leaf nodes amongst the leaf have some leaf nodes amongst the leaf have some leaf nodes amongst the leaf node find the smallest value dilip node node find the smallest value dilip node
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,13:25,13:34,node find the smallest value dilip node delete that node along with the edge delete that node along with the edge delete that node along with the edge that it is along with the so since its that it is along with the so since its that it is along with the so since its a leaf node its connected to one node
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,13:34,13:58,a leaf node its connected to one node a leaf node its connected to one node delete that particular edge and output the neighbor of the deleted and output the neighbor of the deleted node okay since it is a leaf node its node okay since it is a leaf node its
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,13:58,14:05,node okay since it is a leaf node its neighbor is unique it is precisely one neighbor is unique it is precisely one neighbor is unique it is precisely one neighbor so that neighbor we will output neighbor so that neighbor we will output neighbor so that neighbor we will output and we repeatedly do this for n minus
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,14:05,14:13,and we repeatedly do this for n minus and we repeatedly do this for n minus two steps we get a sequence of n minus two steps we get a sequence of n minus two steps we get a sequence of n minus two elements so the easy factors every
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,14:13,14:31,two elements so the easy factors every two elements so the easy factors every three produces a unique list of n minus three produces a unique list of n minus three produces a unique list of n minus two elements okay two elements okay two elements okay so there if you give a tree the answer
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,14:31,14:37,so there if you give a tree the answer so there if you give a tree the answer is unique but it could happen that two is unique but it could happen that two is unique but it could happen that two trees could give rise to the same list
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,14:37,14:43,trees could give rise to the same list trees could give rise to the same list it could also happen that certain lists it could also happen that certain lists it could also happen that certain lists cannot be produced by any tree we will cannot be produced by any tree we will
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,14:43,14:50,cannot be produced by any tree we will rule out both these cases this factors rule out both these cases this factors rule out both these cases this factors obvious the the fact that every tree obvious the the fact that every tree obvious the the fact that every tree produces a unique list is obvious
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,14:50,14:59,produces a unique list is obvious produces a unique list is obvious because the algorithm has no randomness because the algorithm has no randomness because the algorithm has no randomness and i mean at each step since the least and i mean at each step since the least and i mean at each step since the least valued leaf node is pick that is unique
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,14:59,15:05,valued leaf node is pick that is unique valued leaf node is pick that is unique and its neighbor is also unique and and its neighbor is also unique and and its neighbor is also unique and therefore if you give a particular tree therefore if you give a particular tree
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,15:05,15:41,therefore if you give a particular tree the output list is automatically fixed the output list is automatically fixed the output list is automatically fixed lets work this out for an example okay so suppose we look at this okay so suppose we look at this particular tree the leaf nodes are nodes
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,15:41,15:51,particular tree the leaf nodes are nodes particular tree the leaf nodes are nodes amp and the least valued leaf node amp and the least valued leaf node amp and the least valued leaf node is so we will delete that and its is so we will delete that and its
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,15:51,16:02,is so we will delete that and its neighbor as so thats what we will neighbor as so thats what we will neighbor as so thats what we will first note ok and now if you look at the first note ok and now if you look at the first note ok and now if you look at the remaining tree the least valued leaf
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,16:02,16:08,remaining tree the least valued leaf remaining tree the least valued leaf node is the node number or the vertex node is the node number or the vertex node is the node number or the vertex number and its neighbor is so we number and its neighbor is so we
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,16:08,16:19,number and its neighbor is so we will remove this and we will write out will remove this and we will write out will remove this and we will write out the number now amongst the remaining the number now amongst the remaining the number now amongst the remaining nodes the leaf are amp
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,16:19,16:32,nodes the leaf are amp nodes the leaf are amp the leaves being and its neighbor is the leaves being and its neighbor is the leaves being and its neighbor is so we will basically remove five and so we will basically remove five and so we will basically remove five and after that we will remove then after
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,16:32,16:39,after that we will remove then after after that we will remove then after we remove amp we remove amp we remove amp and both their neighbors with so when and both their neighbors with so when and both their neighbors with so when is removed we get a amp is removed
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,16:39,16:49,is removed we get a amp is removed is removed we get a amp is removed we again get a and at this point the we again get a and at this point the we again get a and at this point the tree consists of amp and if we look
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,16:49,16:56,tree consists of amp and if we look tree consists of amp and if we look at the leaves that are precisely at the leaves that are precisely at the leaves that are precisely leaves amp the least valued one is leaves amp the least valued one is leaves amp the least valued one is and its neighbors
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,16:56,17:10,and its neighbors and its neighbors okay so this is the sequence that we okay so this is the sequence that we okay so this is the sequence that we get okay now what we will sheamus if we get okay now what we will sheamus if we get okay now what we will sheamus if we know the underlying vertex set from that
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,17:10,17:25,know the underlying vertex set from that know the underlying vertex set from that information and from this numbers information and from this numbers information and from this numbers we can recover back the tree so i we can recover back the tree so i we can recover back the tree so i hope this process is clear we can just
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,17:25,17:30,hope this process is clear we can just hope this process is clear we can just the interative step is at each stage but the interative step is at each stage but the interative step is at each stage but the least valued leaf node delete the the least valued leaf node delete the
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,17:30,17:37,the least valued leaf node delete the edge corresponding to it and we note the edge corresponding to it and we note the edge corresponding to it and we note the neighbor of the deleted node okay so neighbor of the deleted node okay so neighbor of the deleted node okay so lets just look at this sequence
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,17:37,17:52,lets just look at this sequence lets just look at this sequence and try and generate the tree back suppose we know just this information suppose we know just this information and we dont have access to what was the and we dont have access to what was the and we dont have access to what was the original tree from this can be recovered
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,17:52,17:59,original tree from this can be recovered original tree from this can be recovered back the tree if you look at the back the tree if you look at the back the tree if you look at the sequence one thing that we know is there sequence one thing that we know is there
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,17:59,18:35,sequence one thing that we know is there are two facts that we can know every leaf node will be absent from the leaf node will be absent from the proofer code and the second aspect is proofer code and the second aspect is proofer code and the second aspect is every internal node will be present in
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,18:35,18:42,every internal node will be present in every internal node will be present in the proofer code why is this so the leaf the proofer code why is this so the leaf the proofer code why is this so the leaf node the only numbers which appear in node the only numbers which appear in
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,18:42,18:51,node the only numbers which appear in this till are internal nodes thats this till are internal nodes thats this till are internal nodes thats because the leaf node is a node that you because the leaf node is a node that you because the leaf node is a node that you would remove and when it is removed the

217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,18:58,19:03,appear in the proofer code at some time appear in the proofer code at some time it will have to be an internal node so it will have to be an internal node so it will have to be an internal node so we can clearly see that the leaf nodes
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,19:03,19:07,we can clearly see that the leaf nodes we can clearly see that the leaf nodes will be surely absent from the proofer will be surely absent from the proofer will be surely absent from the proofer code if you look at the process of code if you look at the process of
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,19:07,19:13,code if you look at the process of generating the proofer code we starting generating the proofer code we starting generating the proofer code we starting at a tree and we are systematically at a tree and we are systematically at a tree and we are systematically removing the edges so there will be a
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,19:13,19:19,removing the edges so there will be a removing the edges so there will be a point at which any node its degree will point at which any node its degree will point at which any node its degree will keep on decreasing and there will be a keep on decreasing and there will be a
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,19:19,19:27,keep on decreasing and there will be a point when it is a it becomes either point when it is a it becomes either point when it is a it becomes either or in the process of generating the or in the process of generating the or in the process of generating the proofer code we took a tree and we were
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,19:27,19:32,proofer code we took a tree and we were proofer code we took a tree and we were removing the edges one after other if removing the edges one after other if removing the edges one after other if you look at the initial tree the process you look at the initial tree the process
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,19:32,19:40,you look at the initial tree the process of generating the proofer code basically of generating the proofer code basically of generating the proofer code basically removes an edge from the tree removes an edge from the tree removes an edge from the tree one edge at a time so every internal
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,19:40,19:45,one edge at a time so every internal one edge at a time so every internal node is going to lose some of the edges node is going to lose some of the edges node is going to lose some of the edges corresponding to it and when this corresponding to it and when this
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,19:45,19:53,corresponding to it and when this happens that node is going to appear in happens that node is going to appear in happens that node is going to appear in the proofer code and therefore we can the proofer code and therefore we can the proofer code and therefore we can argue that every internal node will be
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,19:53,20:00,argue that every internal node will be argue that every internal node will be present in the proofer code ok if you present in the proofer code ok if you present in the proofer code ok if you note these things note these things note these things we know by looking at the prefer quote
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,20:00,20:07,we know by looking at the prefer quote we know by looking at the prefer quote two four three three three four that the two four three three three four that the two four three three three four that the leaf nodes essentially had to be the leaf nodes essentially had to be the
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,20:07,20:14,leaf nodes essentially had to be the missing numbers so this is a sequence of missing numbers so this is a sequence of missing numbers so this is a sequence of length the length is six and if the length the length is six and if the length the length is six and if the vertices were numbered one to eight the
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,20:14,20:22,vertices were numbered one to eight the vertices were numbered one to eight the leaf nodes would have been one five six leaf nodes would have been one five six leaf nodes would have been one five six seven eight okay we can look at the seven eight okay we can look at the
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,20:22,20:32,seven eight okay we can look at the diagram and see that this is indeed the diagram and see that this is indeed the diagram and see that this is indeed the case one five six seven and eight and case one five six seven and eight and case one five six seven and eight and amongst these the first one to be
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,20:32,20:38,amongst these the first one to be amongst these the first one to be removed would have been one and that removed would have been one and that removed would have been one and that should have been connected to two so should have been connected to two so should have been connected to two so would have been an edge and if you look
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,20:38,20:49,would have been an edge and if you look would have been an edge and if you look at the remaining sequence now at the remaining sequence now at the remaining sequence now is missing and therefore must have is missing and therefore must have is missing and therefore must have been a leaf node for that particular
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,20:49,20:56,been a leaf node for that particular been a leaf node for that particular tree so we can say that two must have tree so we can say that two must have tree so we can say that two must have been connected to four ok is still been connected to four ok is still
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,20:56,21:07,been connected to four ok is still present and amongst the numbers that are present and amongst the numbers that are present and amongst the numbers that are not present the least one is and not present the least one is and not present the least one is and lists to be connected to the next
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,21:07,21:19,lists to be connected to the next lists to be connected to the next missing number is so is also missing number is so is also missing number is so is also connected to and then you have is connected to and then you have is connected to and then you have is also connected to and after this point
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,21:19,21:23,also connected to and after this point also connected to and after this point is no longer going to be present and is no longer going to be present and is no longer going to be present and therefore must have been connected to therefore must have been connected to
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,21:23,21:35,therefore must have been connected to and then at this point theres only and then at this point theres only and then at this point theres only one node that is remaining that is and one node that is remaining that is and one node that is remaining that is and that must have been connected to
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,21:35,21:42,that must have been connected to that must have been connected to so from this number we could in some so from this number we could in some so from this number we could in some sense generate the tree we have been sense generate the tree we have been
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,21:42,21:51,sense generate the tree we have been given a formal proof we will do that given a formal proof we will do that given a formal proof we will do that shortly vertex is connected to shortly vertex is connected to shortly vertex is connected to and vertex is connected to into and

217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,22:08,22:34,trees for kn is equal to n raise to n trees for kn is equal to n raise to n minus so let us assume that the minus so let us assume that the minus so let us assume that the vertices are from a set s which we will
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,22:34,22:57,vertices are from a set s which we will vertices are from a set s which we will assume to be an ordered set and let t assume to be an ordered set and let t assume to be an ordered set and let t denote the set of spanning trees
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,22:57,23:15,and ill denote the set of lists of size and ill denote the set of lists of size n minus where we will assume the n minus where we will assume the n minus where we will assume the choice of s is equal to n so lets of choice of s is equal to n so lets of
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,23:15,23:34,choice of s is equal to n so lets of size n minus over s ok what we will size n minus over s ok what we will size n minus over s ok what we will prove us there exists a bijection prove us there exists a bijection prove us there exists a bijection between t and l so we will prove this by
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,23:34,23:43,between t and l so we will prove this by between t and l so we will prove this by induction base cases we had already induction base cases we had already induction base cases we had already checked when n is equal to lets say checked when n is equal to lets say
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,23:43,23:57,checked when n is equal to lets say we had verified that t contains if you we had verified that t contains if you we had verified that t contains if you call this as tn tn contains elements call this as tn tn contains elements call this as tn tn contains elements and the list also contains elements so
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,23:57,24:04,and the list also contains elements so and the list also contains elements so because what you are looking at is list because what you are looking at is list because what you are looking at is list of size minus so that is list of of size minus so that is list of
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,24:04,24:12,of size minus so that is list of size over s and there are precisely size over s and there are precisely size over s and there are precisely elements in s so the lists of size are elements in s so the lists of size are elements in s so the lists of size are precisely so the base case can be
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,24:12,24:22,precisely so the base case can be precisely so the base case can be easily checked now lets assume that the easily checked now lets assume that the easily checked now lets assume that the induction hypothesis holds for all induction hypothesis holds for all induction hypothesis holds for all values up to m minus okay now we want
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,24:22,24:30,values up to m minus okay now we want values up to m minus okay now we want to show that for m also the statement is to show that for m also the statement is to show that for m also the statement is true ok so let us look at particular
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,24:30,25:01,true ok so let us look at particular true ok so let us look at particular sequence so every sequence on s of size sequence so every sequence on s of size sequence so every sequence on s of size n minus corresponds to a unique spanning tree so lets look at a
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,25:01,25:10,spanning tree so lets look at a particular sequence so if we call the particular sequence so if we call the particular sequence so if we call the sequence by a and thats equal to a a sequence by a and thats equal to a a sequence by a and thats equal to a a a n minus we will exhibit a
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,25:10,25:17,a n minus we will exhibit a a n minus we will exhibit a corresponding to this and we will argue corresponding to this and we will argue corresponding to this and we will argue that that tree is a unique tree now if that that tree is a unique tree now if
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,25:17,25:26,that that tree is a unique tree now if you look at let us say a a n minus you look at let us say a a n minus you look at let us say a a n minus that again as a sequence of length n that again as a sequence of length n

217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,25:35,25:42,under consideration here we will under consideration here we will inductively argue that a unique spanning inductively argue that a unique spanning inductively argue that a unique spanning tree can be constructed corresponding to tree can be constructed corresponding to tree can be constructed corresponding to that to that spanning tree we add a
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,25:42,25:47,that to that spanning tree we add a that to that spanning tree we add a particular edge and we will get this particular edge and we will get this particular edge and we will get this tree that we are interested in so lets tree that we are interested in so lets
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,25:47,26:12,tree that we are interested in so lets our line of attack so lets look at it our line of attack so lets look at it our line of attack so lets look at it more carefully so look at the smallest more carefully so look at the smallest more carefully so look at the smallest number that is not present in a ok lets
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,26:12,26:17,number that is not present in a ok lets number that is not present in a ok lets call it as x we had argued earlier that call it as x we had argued earlier that call it as x we had argued earlier that the numbers that are missing in a a
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,26:17,26:23,the numbers that are missing in a a the numbers that are missing in a a up to a n minus has to be clearly up to a n minus has to be clearly up to a n minus has to be clearly leaves and the smallest of them would
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,26:23,26:28,leaves and the smallest of them would leaves and the smallest of them would have been the first node that would have have been the first node that would have have been the first node that would have been removed when we were constructing been removed when we were constructing
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,26:28,26:34,been removed when we were constructing the spanning tree so if we look at that the spanning tree so if we look at that the spanning tree so if we look at that node and call it as x clearly x is the node and call it as x clearly x is the
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,26:34,26:45,node and call it as x clearly x is the node is a leaf node that was removed node is a leaf node that was removed node is a leaf node that was removed initially and x would have been initially and x would have been initially and x would have been connected to a now if we look at this
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,26:45,26:56,connected to a now if we look at this connected to a now if we look at this set s minus x this is a set of size n set s minus x this is a set of size n set s minus x this is a set of size n minus and if you look at the
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,26:56,27:10,minus and if you look at the minus and if you look at the subsequence a to a and minus this subsequence a to a and minus this subsequence a to a and minus this sequence cannot contain x in it this sequence cannot contain x in it this sequence cannot contain x in it this does not contain x in it because the
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,27:10,27:19,does not contain x in it because the does not contain x in it because the original sequence itself didnt contain original sequence itself didnt contain original sequence itself didnt contain x so a subsequence surely cannot contain x so a subsequence surely cannot contain x so a subsequence surely cannot contain x and by our induction hypothesis this
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,27:19,27:36,x and by our induction hypothesis this x and by our induction hypothesis this part a a is going to correspond part a a is going to correspond part a a is going to correspond to a unique t prime now that with the edge x a will now that with the edge x a will correspond to this particular sequence
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,27:36,27:52,correspond to this particular sequence correspond to this particular sequence so t union the edge x a t prime union so t union the edge x a t prime union so t union the edge x a t prime union x a if we call this as t t is spanning
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,27:52,28:12,x a if we call this as t t is spanning x a if we call this as t t is spanning tree whose proof or code is a why is tree whose proof or code is a why is tree whose proof or code is a why is this so well clearly if you add x a to
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,28:12,28:19,this so well clearly if you add x a to this so well clearly if you add x a to t prime it does not create a nice cycle t prime it does not create a nice cycle t prime it does not create a nice cycle because we assumed that x is not present
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,28:19,28:23,because we assumed that x is not present because we assumed that x is not present here so that would make x a leaf and if here so that would make x a leaf and if here so that would make x a leaf and if you attach a leaf to some other node
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,28:23,28:28,you attach a leaf to some other node you attach a leaf to some other node thats not going to create a cycle so thats not going to create a cycle so thats not going to create a cycle so the newer the graph that you get is the newer the graph that you get is
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,28:28,28:32,the newer the graph that you get is indeed going to be a tree and if you indeed going to be a tree and if you indeed going to be a tree and if you look at the proof or code of that thats look at the proof or code of that thats
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,28:32,28:38,look at the proof or code of that thats precisely going to be a a a n minus precisely going to be a a a n minus precisely going to be a a a n minus okay so this is basically the proof okay so this is basically the proof
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,28:38,28:46,okay so this is basically the proof this says that corresponding to every this says that corresponding to every this says that corresponding to every sequence you can get a unique spanning sequence you can get a unique spanning sequence you can get a unique spanning tree the uniqueness comes out because a
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,28:46,28:52,tree the uniqueness comes out because a tree the uniqueness comes out because a to n minus by induction hypothesis to n minus by induction hypothesis to n minus by induction hypothesis has a unique t prime and the only tree has a unique t prime and the only tree
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,28:52,28:59,has a unique t prime and the only tree that is going to be obtained is by that is going to be obtained is by that is going to be obtained is by adding xa to t so the only tree that adding xa to t so the only tree that
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,28:59,29:05,adding xa to t so the only tree that could possibly correspond to this could possibly correspond to this could possibly correspond to this sequence the only graph that could sequence the only graph that could sequence the only graph that could possibly corresponding to correspond to possibly corresponding to correspond to
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,29:05,29:14,possibly corresponding to correspond to this particular proof or sequence or this particular proof or sequence or this particular proof or sequence or this particular code is going to be t this particular code is going to be t this particular code is going to be t that is obtained by adding the x a x
217.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,29:14,29:21,that is obtained by adding the x a x that is obtained by adding the x a x a a n minus so that concludes the a a n minus so that concludes the a a n minus so that concludes the proof and the lecture

218.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,2:13,2:21,all natural numbers so as you can see all natural numbers so as you can see omega contains the empty set which is omega contains the empty set which is omega contains the empty set which is its the success of its successor its the success of its successor its the success of its successor and so on so by necessity because it

218.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,6:53,7:02,root is rational then we will be able to represent root as a fraction a to represent root as a fraction a to represent root as a fraction a prime by b prime where a prime and b prime by b prime where a prime and b prime by b prime where a prime and b prime are integers so consider this
218.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,7:02,7:07,prime are integers so consider this prime are integers so consider this fraction a prime by b prime fraction a prime by b prime fraction a prime by b prime out of a prime and b prime we can remove out of a prime and b prime we can remove
218.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,7:07,7:14,out of a prime and b prime we can remove the common factors the common factors the common factors and get this fraction in a reduced form and get this fraction in a reduced form and get this fraction in a reduced form let us say a by b is the reduced form
218.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,7:14,7:20,let us say a by b is the reduced form let us say a by b is the reduced form what i mean is that n we do not have a what i mean is that n we do not have a what i mean is that n we do not have a common factor or that gcd of a and b is
218.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,7:20,7:26,common factor or that gcd of a and b is common factor or that gcd of a and b is so if root is a rational number then so if root is a rational number then so if root is a rational number then there exists a and b so that root is a
218.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,7:26,7:33,there exists a and b so that root is a there exists a and b so that root is a and b and g c d f a be equal to so and b and g c d f a be equal to so and b and g c d f a be equal to so root is a by b if root is a by b
218.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,7:33,7:39,root is a by b if root is a by b root is a by b if root is a by b then root b is a squaring both sides then root b is a squaring both sides then root b is a squaring both sides we have b squared equal to esquire so
218.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,7:39,7:44,we have b squared equal to esquire so we have b squared equal to esquire so a squared is a square that is what we a squared is a square that is what we a squared is a square that is what we have on the right hand side on the left
218.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,7:44,7:48,have on the right hand side on the left have on the right hand side on the left hand side we have b squared which is hand side we have b squared which is hand side we have b squared which is an even number its multiplied by an even number its multiplied by
218.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,7:48,7:59,an even number its multiplied by something which means a squared is an something which means a squared is an something which means a squared is an even squad we know that an even square even squad we know that an even square even squad we know that an even square is the square of an even number the
218.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,7:59,8:03,is the square of an even number the is the square of an even number the square of an odd number is always odd square of an odd number is always odd square of an odd number is always odd therefore if a squared is an even number therefore if a squared is an even number
218.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,8:03,8:10,therefore if a squared is an even number then a is also an even number so is even then a is also an even number so is even then a is also an even number so is even so let a be k then substituting in so let a be k then substituting in
218.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,8:10,8:23,so let a be k then substituting in this equation we have ax squared equal this equation we have ax squared equal this equation we have ax squared equal to b squared so a squared equal to k to b squared so a squared equal to k to b squared so a squared equal to k squared which is equal to b squad so
218.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,8:23,8:30,squared which is equal to b squad so squared which is equal to b squad so in particular let us consider this in particular let us consider this in particular let us consider this equation for k squared equal to v equation for k squared equal to v equation for k squared equal to v squared so is a common factor on both
218.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,8:30,8:36,squared so is a common factor on both squared so is a common factor on both sides sides sides so let us cancel from both sides so we so let us cancel from both sides so we so let us cancel from both sides so we have k squared equal to b squared
218.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,8:36,8:42,have k squared equal to b squared have k squared equal to b squared now k squared is even therefore b now k squared is even therefore b now k squared is even therefore b squared is even as well which means b squared is even as well which means b
218.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,8:42,8:52,squared is even as well which means b squared is an even square which means b squared is an even square which means b squared is an even square which means b is even but then we had earlier found is even but then we had earlier found is even but then we had earlier found that a is even so is even and b is even
218.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,8:52,8:57,that a is even so is even and b is even that a is even so is even and b is even which means is a common factor of a which means is a common factor of a which means is a common factor of a and b or in other words gcd if a b is
218.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,8:57,9:03,and b or in other words gcd if a b is and b or in other words gcd if a b is greater than or equal to at least is greater than or equal to at least is greater than or equal to at least is a common factor which is a contradiction
218.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,9:03,9:09,a common factor which is a contradiction a common factor which is a contradiction because here we assume that gcd of a be because here we assume that gcd of a be because here we assume that gcd of a be equal to root has been written in equal to root has been written in
218.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,9:09,9:13,equal to root has been written in the reduced form a by b so a and b do the reduced form a by b so a and b do the reduced form a by b so a and b do not have a common factor but here we not have a common factor but here we
218.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,9:13,9:21,not have a common factor but here we find that is a common factor which is find that is a common factor which is find that is a common factor which is a contradiction therefore root cannot a contradiction therefore root cannot a contradiction therefore root cannot be rational rudo is irrational so
218.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,9:21,9:28,be rational rudo is irrational so be rational rudo is irrational so our rational numbers so there are real our rational numbers so there are real our rational numbers so there are real numbers which are not rational numbers which are not rational numbers which are not rational now we are trying to embed the theory of

218.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,19:21,19:28,construction so if the fractions that we had were like this then the first had were like this then the first had were like this then the first fraction here has in the first fraction here has in the first fraction here has in the first position so in the new fraction that we
218.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,19:28,19:37,position so in the new fraction that we position so in the new fraction that we construct we will write plus we construct we will write plus we construct we will write plus we had in the second position of the had in the second position of the had in the second position of the second fraction so we would write in
218.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,19:37,19:41,second fraction so we would write in second fraction so we would write in the second position of the new fraction the second position of the new fraction the second position of the new fraction we had in the third position of the we had in the third position of the
218.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,19:41,19:46,we had in the third position of the third fraction so we will write in the third fraction so we will write in the third fraction so we will write in the third position of the new fraction and third position of the new fraction and third position of the new fraction and so on so the new fraction that we
218.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,19:46,19:53,so on so the new fraction that we so on so the new fraction that we construct does not match any of the construct does not match any of the construct does not match any of the existing fractions so this technique is existing fractions so this technique is existing fractions so this technique is called the diagonalization technique

219.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,12:48,12:57,therefore x will have to have an image therefore x will have to have an image under f as well but then x has two under f as well but then x has two under f as well but then x has two images under r to form f you will have
219.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,12:57,13:04,images under r to form f you will have images under r to form f you will have to pick one of them that is you have to to pick one of them that is you have to to pick one of them that is you have to exercise the choice y or y do one of
219.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,13:04,13:12,exercise the choice y or y do one of exercise the choice y or y do one of them will be f of x for the function f them will be f of x for the function f them will be f of x for the function f that we are going to construct therefore
219.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,13:12,13:21,that we are going to construct therefore that we are going to construct therefore we are exercising a choice when we we are exercising a choice when we we are exercising a choice when we construct function f so what axiom of construct function f so what axiom of construct function f so what axiom of choice is that for any relation are the

219.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,21:24,21:29,say this is the origin and this is so we are considering the set of all points we are considering the set of all points we are considering the set of all points from to on the real line we want to from to on the real line we want to
219.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,21:29,21:41,from to on the real line we want to show that this set as equinumerous with show that this set as equinumerous with show that this set as equinumerous with the points from the real line itself to the points from the real line itself to the points from the real line itself to prove this what we do is this consider

219.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,21:47,21:56,that is a line segment from to we take it and bend it so that it forms a take it and bend it so that it forms a take it and bend it so that it forms a semicircle and arrange the semicircle so semicircle and arrange the semicircle so
219.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,21:56,22:09,semicircle and arrange the semicircle so that the real line is a tangent to the that the real line is a tangent to the that the real line is a tangent to the semicircle so the length of the semicircle so the length of the semicircle so the length of the semicircle is because this has been
219.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,22:09,22:21,semicircle is because this has been semicircle is because this has been obtained from the interval to by obtained from the interval to by obtained from the interval to by bending the interval to so this has bending the interval to so this has bending the interval to so this has a radius of by pi
219.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,22:21,22:43,so the origin of the circle would be so the origin of the circle would be minus by on the real plane so this minus by on the real plane so this minus by on the real plane so this is what the origin is and then let us is what the origin is and then let us
219.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,22:43,23:00,is what the origin is and then let us say we draw a line passing through the say we draw a line passing through the say we draw a line passing through the origin of the circle and some point on origin of the circle and some point on origin of the circle and some point on the real line this way the ray with the
219.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,23:00,23:12,the real line this way the ray with the the real line this way the ray with the origin as its vertex will intersect the origin as its vertex will intersect the origin as its vertex will intersect the semicircle at some point and it will semicircle at some point and it will
219.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,23:12,23:23,semicircle at some point and it will intersect the real line exactly one intersect the real line exactly one intersect the real line exactly one point then let us define a function f point then let us define a function f point then let us define a function f which maps the circular point onto the
219.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,23:23,23:35,which maps the circular point onto the which maps the circular point onto the real line point so f is defined in this real line point so f is defined in this real line point so f is defined in this manner so this function f maps the manner so this function f maps the
219.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,23:35,24:03,manner so this function f maps the interval to instead of another line for example this instead of another line for example this will pass through these two points so will pass through these two points so will pass through these two points so this point is mapped to and negative
219.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,24:03,24:15,this point is mapped to and negative this point is mapped to and negative real number so it shows that the real number so it shows that the real number so it shows that the interval to has a to onto interval to has a to onto interval to has a to onto mapping to the set of all real numbers
219.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,24:15,24:30,mapping to the set of all real numbers mapping to the set of all real numbers therefore the interval to is equal therefore the interval to is equal therefore the interval to is equal muris with the set of all real numbers let this be the notation for the set of

219.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,30:26,30:34,then b is the same as f of x then x belongs to f of x if x belongs to f of x belongs to f of x if x belongs to f of x belongs to f of x if x belongs to f of x then x should not belong to b because b
219.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,30:34,30:42,then x should not belong to b because b then x should not belong to b because b happens to be the set of precisely those happens to be the set of precisely those happens to be the set of precisely those that do not own themselves so if x
219.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,30:42,30:48,that do not own themselves so if x that do not own themselves so if x belongs to f of x then x owns itself so belongs to f of x then x owns itself so belongs to f of x then x owns itself so x shouldnt belong to b on the other
219.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,30:48,31:00,x shouldnt belong to b on the other x shouldnt belong to b on the other hand if x does not belong to b then x hand if x does not belong to b then x hand if x does not belong to b then x doesnt own itself this implies that x
219.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,31:00,31:07,doesnt own itself this implies that x doesnt own itself this implies that x belongs to b so either way we get a belongs to b so either way we get a belongs to b so either way we get a contradiction therefore what we have is contradiction therefore what we have is
219.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,31:07,31:35,contradiction therefore what we have is that b is not equal to f of x for any x but bees of course a subset of a which but bees of course a subset of a which means b is a member of to power a therefore there is a member of to power
219.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,31:35,32:03,therefore there is a member of to power a that is not an image under the function f or in other words f under the function f or in other words f is not one to mind you the function f is not one to mind you the function f

220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,24:37,24:43,ordered end up will be one to be in ordered end up will be one to be in according to this ordering if ai equal according to this ordering if ai equal according to this ordering if ai equal to bi for one less than or equal to i to bi for one less than or equal to i
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,24:43,24:51,to bi for one less than or equal to i less than or equal to k minus one for less than or equal to k minus one for less than or equal to k minus one for some k and it is the case that for that some k and it is the case that for that
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,24:51,24:56,some k and it is the case that for that particular k a k less than or equal to particular k a k less than or equal to particular k a k less than or equal to be k so we dont look at the positions be k so we dont look at the positions
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,24:56,25:02,be k so we dont look at the positions which are further to the right of k that which are further to the right of k that which are further to the right of k that is k plus through n could be anything is k plus through n could be anything
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,25:02,25:10,is k plus through n could be anything so these two ordered pairs order tuples so these two ordered pairs order tuples so these two ordered pairs order tuples match in the first k minus positions match in the first k minus positions match in the first k minus positions and when you look at the gate position
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,25:10,25:16,and when you look at the gate position and when you look at the gate position a through a n has a smaller value a through a n has a smaller value a through a n has a smaller value therefore we said that even through a n therefore we said that even through a n
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,25:16,25:26,therefore we said that even through a n precedes b through b in this is precedes b through b in this is precedes b through b in this is opposed to the previous ordering that we opposed to the previous ordering that we opposed to the previous ordering that we saw so these two are different orderings
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,25:26,25:39,saw so these two are different orderings saw so these two are different orderings of other tuples and then we can consider of other tuples and then we can consider of other tuples and then we can consider strings in general we can consider an strings in general we can consider an
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,25:39,25:50,strings in general we can consider an alphabet sigma and we can talk about all alphabet sigma and we can talk about all alphabet sigma and we can talk about all strings from alphabet sigma which is strings from alphabet sigma which is strings from alphabet sigma which is denoted by sigma star this is the klean
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,25:50,26:08,denoted by sigma star this is the klean denoted by sigma star this is the klean closure of sigma this would of course consider the null this would of course consider the null string the string of no length which was string the string of no length which was string the string of no length which was made up of no character then it will
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,26:08,26:19,made up of no character then it will made up of no character then it will have all strings of length one all have all strings of length one all have all strings of length one all strings of length two and so on strings of length two and so on
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,26:19,26:27,strings of length two and so on you can form an infinite set of strings you can form an infinite set of strings you can form an infinite set of strings from sigma from sigma from sigma even if sigma is finite so this set is even if sigma is finite so this set is
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,26:27,26:50,even if sigma is finite so this set is sigma star sigma star could be sigma star sigma star could be sigma star sigma star could be lexicographically ordered which means in dictionary order you would prefer to dictionary order you would prefer to order them in this way we will say that
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,26:50,27:01,order them in this way we will say that order them in this way we will say that the null string epsilon is less than w the null string epsilon is less than w the null string epsilon is less than w for any nonempty w any non empty string
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,27:01,27:08,for any nonempty w any non empty string for any nonempty w any non empty string w from sigma strong will have this w from sigma strong will have this w from sigma strong will have this property it will come after the null property it will come after the null
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,27:08,27:27,property it will come after the null string secondly if u is character symbol string secondly if u is character symbol string secondly if u is character symbol a followed by u prime and v is symbol be a followed by u prime and v is symbol be a followed by u prime and v is symbol be followed by v prime where a and b are
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,27:27,27:36,followed by v prime where a and b are followed by v prime where a and b are symbols u prime and v prime are strings symbols u prime and v prime are strings symbols u prime and v prime are strings from sigma strong then we would say that
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,27:36,27:48,from sigma strong then we would say that from sigma strong then we would say that u is less than or equal to v or u u is less than or equal to v or u u is less than or equal to v or u precedes b in this ordering if either a
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,27:48,28:07,precedes b in this ordering if either a precedes b in this ordering if either a less than or equal to b or a equal to b less than or equal to b or a equal to b less than or equal to b or a equal to b and u prime precedes v prime
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,28:07,28:40,of course often we find a variant of of course often we find a variant of lexicographic ordering which would be lexicographic ordering which would be lexicographic ordering which would be lexicographic ordering within the same lexicographic ordering within the same lexicographic ordering within the same length so this ordering would be like
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,28:40,28:48,length so this ordering would be like length so this ordering would be like this if sigma happens to be a and b just this if sigma happens to be a and b just this if sigma happens to be a and b just two symbols then sigma star would be
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,28:48,28:58,two symbols then sigma star would be two symbols then sigma star would be ordered thus first you enumerate the ordered thus first you enumerate the ordered thus first you enumerate the null string then we have strings of null string then we have strings of null string then we have strings of length one a and b then we have strings
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,28:58,29:12,length one a and b then we have strings length one a and b then we have strings of length two a a a b b a and b b then of length two a a a b b a and b b then of length two a a a b b a and b b then we enumerate all strings of length three
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,29:12,29:22,and so on and so on that is within the same length we that is within the same length we that is within the same length we enumerate the strings in lexicographic enumerate the strings in lexicographic enumerate the strings in lexicographic ordering but strings will be enumerated ordering but strings will be enumerated
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,29:22,29:45,ordering but strings will be enumerated in the monotonic order of increasing in the monotonic order of increasing in the monotonic order of increasing length now we study half the diagrams we say that a immediately precedes me we say that a immediately precedes me this notation says a immediately
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,29:45,30:06,this notation says a immediately this notation says a immediately precedes c precedes b what it means is precedes c precedes b what it means is precedes c precedes b what it means is that a precedes b and there is no c such that a precedes b and there is no c such
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,30:06,30:18,that a precedes b and there is no c such that a precedes c which precedes b so that a precedes c which precedes b so that a precedes c which precedes b so there is no intermediate element between there is no intermediate element between there is no intermediate element between a and b so in this case we say that a is
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,30:18,30:30,a and b so in this case we say that a is a and b so in this case we say that a is an immediate predecessor of b or an immediate predecessor of b or an immediate predecessor of b or conversely b is an immediate successor conversely b is an immediate successor
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,30:30,30:46,conversely b is an immediate successor of a in a hasse diagram we draw the of a in a hasse diagram we draw the of a in a hasse diagram we draw the partial order using lines going from partial order using lines going from partial order using lines going from below to above we do not usually place
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,30:46,30:53,below to above we do not usually place below to above we do not usually place an arrow when we place a and b in this an arrow when we place a and b in this an arrow when we place a and b in this manner what we mean is that a is an
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,30:53,31:01,manner what we mean is that a is an manner what we mean is that a is an immediate predecessor of b so the less immediate predecessor of b so the less immediate predecessor of b so the less than or equal to relation now flows from than or equal to relation now flows from
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,31:01,31:17,than or equal to relation now flows from below to above so let us consider an below to above so let us consider an below to above so let us consider an example let us consider the example of example let us consider the example of example let us consider the example of setting lotion we consider set a with
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,31:17,31:23,setting lotion we consider set a with setting lotion we consider set a with conscious of two elements a and b and conscious of two elements a and b and conscious of two elements a and b and let us look at the power set of a which let us look at the power set of a which
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,31:23,31:39,let us look at the power set of a which is to power a the members of to power a is to power a the members of to power a is to power a the members of to power a are a itself singletons a and b and the empty set as
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,31:39,31:48,singletons a and b and the empty set as we saw earlier so in the hasse diagram we saw earlier so in the hasse diagram we saw earlier so in the hasse diagram we find that the empty set is included we find that the empty set is included we find that the empty set is included in the singleton be the empty set the
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,31:48,31:56,in the singleton be the empty set the in the singleton be the empty set the singleton the singleton a as well so we singleton the singleton a as well so we singleton the singleton a as well so we draw lines in this manner to show that draw lines in this manner to show that
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,31:56,32:02,draw lines in this manner to show that phi is less than or equal to b here less phi is less than or equal to b here less phi is less than or equal to b here less than or equal to stands for the subset than or equal to stands for the subset
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,32:02,32:15,than or equal to stands for the subset relation and similarly we have lines of relation and similarly we have lines of relation and similarly we have lines of the sort to so this is the set inclusion the sort to so this is the set inclusion the sort to so this is the set inclusion partial order for two member elements if

220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,32:56,33:55,immediate predecessor of abc then we have singletons a b and c we have yes and then we have the empty set let yes and then we have the empty set let us control the divisibility relation on us control the divisibility relation on us control the divisibility relation on the side and
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,33:55,34:02,the diagram will be drawn like this n the diagram will be drawn like this n are incomparable so you cannot have an are incomparable so you cannot have an are incomparable so you cannot have an edge between them so they are placed at edge between them so they are placed at
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,34:02,34:12,edge between them so they are placed at the same level divided and the same level divided and the same level divided and doesnt divide now when we come to doesnt divide now when we come to doesnt divide now when we come to we know the divides so we have an

220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,34:19,34:29,now doesnt divide any of the previous numbers its a prime and the previous numbers its a prime and the previous numbers its a prime and the previous numbers do not divide then we have numbers do not divide then we have numbers do not divide then we have is divided by both and so we have
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,34:29,34:42,is divided by both and so we have is divided by both and so we have edges from two and three to six seven is edges from two and three to six seven is edges from two and three to six seven is a prime is a multiple of is a
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,34:42,35:03,a prime is a multiple of is a a prime is a multiple of is a multiple of is a multiple of and multiple of is a multiple of and multiple of is a multiple of and eleven is a prime is a multiple of eleven is a prime is a multiple of six as well as for that is there is an
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,35:03,35:10,six as well as for that is there is an six as well as for that is there is an immediate predecessor relation between immediate predecessor relation between immediate predecessor relation between four and we do not draw an edge from four and we do not draw an edge from
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,35:10,35:23,four and we do not draw an edge from to even to is a divisor of to even to is a divisor of to even to is a divisor of thats because is not an immediate thats because is not an immediate thats because is not an immediate predecessor of because is in
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,35:23,35:33,predecessor of because is in predecessor of because is in between divides and whites so between divides and whites so between divides and whites so there is a chain of disabilities from there is a chain of disabilities from there is a chain of disabilities from to a chain of length more than
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,35:33,35:43,therefore there is an edge from to therefore there is an edge from to but theres no edge from to so this but theres no edge from to so this but theres no edge from to so this would be the has a diagram for the would be the has a diagram for the
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,35:43,35:55,would be the has a diagram for the divisibility on this set the result and divisibility on this set the result and divisibility on this set the result and partial order will be drawn like this partial order will be drawn like this partial order will be drawn like this then let us consider the less than or
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,35:55,36:23,then let us consider the less than or then let us consider the less than or equal to relation on the set here we find that the hostler diagram here we find that the hostler diagram has a simple form which means between any pair of elements which means between any pair of elements the less than or equal to relation holds
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,36:23,36:30,the less than or equal to relation holds the less than or equal to relation holds but in the hazzard diagram we do not but in the hazzard diagram we do not but in the hazzard diagram we do not draw every possible line we show only draw every possible line we show only
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,36:30,36:36,draw every possible line we show only the immediate predecessor so the the immediate predecessor so the the immediate predecessor so the immediate predecessor of four is three immediate predecessor of four is three immediate predecessor of four is three the immediate predecessor of five is the immediate predecessor of five is
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,36:36,36:44,the immediate predecessor of five is four the preceding number in fact to get four the preceding number in fact to get four the preceding number in fact to get the partial order you should take the the partial order you should take the the partial order you should take the you should apply transitivity on this on
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,36:44,36:51,you should apply transitivity on this on you should apply transitivity on this on this predecessor relation that is shown this predecessor relation that is shown this predecessor relation that is shown here for example there is a change from here for example there is a change from here for example there is a change from there is a path from four to six here in
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,36:51,36:57,there is a path from four to six here in there is a path from four to six here in this diagram therefore we know that four this diagram therefore we know that four this diagram therefore we know that four is actually a predecessor of six four is is actually a predecessor of six four is
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,36:57,37:25,is actually a predecessor of six four is less than or equal to six a maximal less than or equal to six a maximal less than or equal to six a maximal element in a poset its an element a such that no element its an element a such that no element this greater than or equal to it oh no
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,37:25,37:31,this greater than or equal to it oh no this greater than or equal to it oh no element is larger than its strictly element is larger than its strictly element is larger than its strictly larger than it so if you look at these larger than it so if you look at these
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,37:31,37:50,larger than it so if you look at these diagrams here the set abc is a maximal diagrams here the set abc is a maximal diagrams here the set abc is a maximal element because no member in the diagram element because no member in the diagram element because no member in the diagram is above abc here we find that
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,37:50,38:21,is above abc here we find that is above abc here we find that those are all maximal elements and those are all maximal elements and those are all maximal elements and here we find that of a maximal element and obviously a minimal element is an and obviously a minimal element is an element such that no element is less
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,38:21,38:28,element such that no element is less element such that no element is less than duck so if you look at these than duck so if you look at these than duck so if you look at these diagrams you find that phi is a minimal diagrams you find that phi is a minimal
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,38:28,38:51,diagrams you find that phi is a minimal element here are all minimal element here are all minimal element here are all minimal elements in this diagram is a minimal elements in this diagram is a minimal elements in this diagram is a minimal element nothingness below so those are
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,38:51,39:12,element nothingness below so those are element nothingness below so those are the maximal and minimal elements we say the maximal and minimal elements we say the maximal and minimal elements we say that an element is the first element is that an element is the first element is that an element is the first element is the first element if for every x its
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,39:12,39:21,the first element if for every x its the first element if for every x its the case that is less than x or is less the case that is less than x or is less the case that is less than x or is less than or equal to x we say that a is the
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,39:21,39:31,than or equal to x we say that a is the than or equal to x we say that a is the last element of the posit if it is the last element of the posit if it is the last element of the posit if it is the dual of this which means for every x x
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,39:31,39:41,dual of this which means for every x x dual of this which means for every x x is less than or equal to x precedes a is less than or equal to x precedes a is less than or equal to x precedes a so if you look at the diagrams here here
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,39:41,39:48,so if you look at the diagrams here here so if you look at the diagrams here here we find that phi is a minimal element we find that phi is a minimal element we find that phi is a minimal element and phi is also the first element set
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,39:48,39:54,and phi is also the first element set and phi is also the first element set abc is a maximal element also the last abc is a maximal element also the last abc is a maximal element also the last element but when we come to this we find element but when we come to this we find
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,39:54,40:01,element but when we come to this we find that it does not have a first element or that it does not have a first element or that it does not have a first element or a last element a are all a last element a are all a last element a are all maximal elements but they are
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,40:01,40:08,maximal elements but they are maximal elements but they are incomparable to each of those so there incomparable to each of those so there incomparable to each of those so there is no element which is a successor of is no element which is a successor of is no element which is a successor of everybody similarly there is no element
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,40:08,40:17,everybody similarly there is no element everybody similarly there is no element which is a predecessor of everybody which is a predecessor of everybody which is a predecessor of everybody are all milliman elements but are all milliman elements but are all milliman elements but there is no first element here here is
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,40:17,40:22,there is no first element here here is there is no first element here here is a maximal element as well as a last a maximal element as well as a last a maximal element as well as a last element is a minimal element as well element is a minimal element as well
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,40:22,40:31,element is a minimal element as well as the as the as the first element so from this we know that first element so from this we know that first element so from this we know that our first element is always a minimal our first element is always a minimal
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,40:31,40:47,our first element is always a minimal element not necessarily vice versa a element not necessarily vice versa a element not necessarily vice versa a last element is always a maximal element last element is always a maximal element last element is always a maximal element and not necessarily voiceover so lets

220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,43:02,43:08,equal to f and is less than or equal equal to f and is less than or equal to seven so once again it is consistent to seven so once again it is consistent to seven so once again it is consistent so you can check that the presidents so you can check that the presidents
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,43:08,43:17,so you can check that the presidents every residence is satisfied for any every residence is satisfied for any every residence is satisfied for any pair of elements x and y so that x pair of elements x and y so that x pair of elements x and y so that x precedes why the number given to x is
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,43:17,43:27,precedes why the number given to x is precedes why the number given to x is less than or equal to the number given less than or equal to the number given less than or equal to the number given to y so here we have a theorem which to y so here we have a theorem which
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,43:27,44:01,to y so here we have a theorem which says that our exes are consistent says that our exes are consistent says that our exes are consistent enumeration so the proof of this theorem is by so the proof of this theorem is by induction on the size of a when a is a
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,44:01,44:12,induction on the size of a when a is a induction on the size of a when a is a singleton we will define f does f of a singleton we will define f does f of a singleton we will define f does f of a equal to one and there is only one

220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,44:44,45:01,now for the induction step consider a now for the induction step consider a set a with n elements then imagine the set a with n elements then imagine the set a with n elements then imagine the hassle diagram for a when you look at hassle diagram for a when you look at
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,45:01,45:13,hassle diagram for a when you look at the hassle diagram you will be able to the hassle diagram you will be able to the hassle diagram you will be able to find a maximal element of a there could find a maximal element of a there could find a maximal element of a there could be many maximal elements let us pick one
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,45:13,45:24,be many maximal elements let us pick one be many maximal elements let us pick one out suppose that is small a then if you out suppose that is small a then if you out suppose that is small a then if you consider a minus a which i call set b we
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,45:24,45:31,consider a minus a which i call set b we consider a minus a which i call set b we find that the size of b is n minus find that the size of b is n minus find that the size of b is n minus therefore b should have a consistent
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,45:31,45:46,therefore b should have a consistent therefore b should have a consistent enumeration so let us say g is a enumeration so let us say g is a enumeration so let us say g is a consistent enumeration for b then a consistent enumeration for b then a consistent enumeration for b then a consistent enumeration for a can be
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,45:46,45:52,consistent enumeration for a can be consistent enumeration for a can be constructed very easily let us define a constructed very easily let us define a constructed very easily let us define a function f f of x will be defined like function f f of x will be defined like
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,45:52,46:04,function f f of x will be defined like this if x equal to a we will put f of x this if x equal to a we will put f of x this if x equal to a we will put f of x s n if x is not a then x is a member of
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,46:04,46:13,s n if x is not a then x is a member of s n if x is not a then x is a member of b as well therefore g is defined for x b as well therefore g is defined for x b as well therefore g is defined for x so we will define f of x as g of x so we
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,46:13,46:18,so we will define f of x as g of x so we so we will define f of x as g of x so we are using the same enumeration as we got are using the same enumeration as we got are using the same enumeration as we got before that is we got an enumeration for
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,46:18,46:23,before that is we got an enumeration for before that is we got an enumeration for b we assumed b x is inductively we take b we assumed b x is inductively we take b we assumed b x is inductively we take that b we take that enumeration and then
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,46:23,46:31,that b we take that enumeration and then that b we take that enumeration and then extend that enumeration by setting the extend that enumeration by setting the extend that enumeration by setting the function value for a to n so a a will function value for a to n so a a will
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,46:31,46:37,function value for a to n so a a will now be the nth element so in the hassle now be the nth element so in the hassle now be the nth element so in the hassle diagram we pick out one maximal element diagram we pick out one maximal element
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,46:37,46:48,diagram we pick out one maximal element so in this case f is the maximal element so in this case f is the maximal element so in this case f is the maximal element and then inductively we number the rest and then inductively we number the rest and then inductively we number the rest of the diagram after that we put f back
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,46:48,46:53,of the diagram after that we put f back of the diagram after that we put f back in place and give f the largest number in place and give f the largest number in place and give f the largest number so in this case that largest number is
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,46:53,46:58,so in this case that largest number is so in this case that largest number is is the number of elements in the is the number of elements in the is the number of elements in the original set original set original set so the numbering that you obtain in this
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,46:58,47:05,so the numbering that you obtain in this so the numbering that you obtain in this fashion is going to be a consistent fashion is going to be a consistent fashion is going to be a consistent enumeration now let us study chains and enumeration now let us study chains and
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,47:05,47:48,enumeration now let us study chains and nd chains so let us consider a posit a and less so let us consider a posit a and less than or equal to a subset of a a subset than or equal to a subset of a a subset than or equal to a subset of a a subset b of a theres a chain if every pair of
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,47:48,48:37,b of a theres a chain if every pair of b of a theres a chain if every pair of elements from b or relate which means b along with the less than which means b along with the less than or equal to relation forms a total order there is the first element and the last
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,48:37,48:57,there is the first element and the last element so a chain is a sequence of elements of so a chain is a sequence of elements of the sort so you can always find the the sort so you can always find the the sort so you can always find the first element and the last element if
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,48:57,49:07,first element and the last element if first element and the last element if you look at the has a diagram of a chain you look at the has a diagram of a chain you look at the has a diagram of a chain it would look like this so the bottommost element is the first
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,49:07,49:26,so the bottommost element is the first element and the topmost element is the element and the topmost element is the element and the topmost element is the last element a subset b of a is an last element a subset b of a is an last element a subset b of a is an antichain if no two elements of b are
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,49:26,49:45,antichain if no two elements of b are antichain if no two elements of b are related so thats the definition of a chain and so thats the definition of a chain and rampd chain so let us take an example now rampd chain so let us take an example now
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,49:45,50:22,rampd chain so let us take an example now let us consider the divisibility let us consider the divisibility let us consider the divisibility relation thats set relation thats set relation thats set and this is the set of devices and this is the set of devices and this is the set of devices of then we have starting from the
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,50:22,50:37,of then we have starting from the of then we have starting from the bottom we have are all primes and bottom we have are all primes and bottom we have are all primes and is a divisor of two three and seven so is a divisor of two three and seven so
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,50:37,50:54,is a divisor of two three and seven so one will be a predecessor of and one will be a predecessor of and one will be a predecessor of and now for as a successor of is a now for as a successor of is a now for as a successor of is a successor of both to entry
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,50:54,51:15,was a successor of six and also a was a successor of six and also a successor of four is a successor of successor of four is a successor of successor of four is a successor of seven and also of is a successor of seven and also of is a successor of

220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,51:42,51:51,number so that divides that number and number so that divides that number and that number the whites so there is no that number the whites so there is no that number the whites so there is no intermediate element between and so intermediate element between and so intermediate element between and so so you have to draw a line from to
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,51:51,52:03,so you have to draw a line from to so you have to draw a line from to then is the successor of which is then is the successor of which is then is the successor of which is also a successor of and is a also a successor of and is a
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,52:03,52:20,also a successor of and is a successor of as well and then we have successor of as well and then we have successor of as well and then we have which is sort of and so this which is sort of and so this which is sort of and so this would be the has a diagram for this
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,52:20,52:41,would be the has a diagram for this would be the has a diagram for this posit so in this if you consider posit so in this if you consider posit so in this if you consider and this is a chain similarly and this is a chain similarly and this is a chain similarly

220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,54:53,55:01,chain has a length of so we have chain has a length of so we have managed to partition this into five managed to partition this into five managed to partition this into five disjoint antichains this are not the disjoint antichains this are not the disjoint antichains this are not the only anti change by any means but this
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,55:01,55:09,only anti change by any means but this only anti change by any means but this is one set of five disjoint antichains is one set of five disjoint antichains is one set of five disjoint antichains so the proof is easy im leaving it as so the proof is easy im leaving it as
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,55:09,55:12,so the proof is easy im leaving it as an exercise to you but to give a hint an exercise to you but to give a hint an exercise to you but to give a hint you can look at the maximal elements you can look at the maximal elements
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,55:12,55:21,you can look at the maximal elements here in this phasor diagram there was here in this phasor diagram there was here in this phasor diagram there was only one maximal element which is so only one maximal element which is so only one maximal element which is so you can take that out then the rest of
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,55:21,55:29,you can take that out then the rest of you can take that out then the rest of the partial order has chains of smaller the partial order has chains of smaller the partial order has chains of smaller lengths and we can apply the statement lengths and we can apply the statement
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,55:29,55:42,lengths and we can apply the statement to that inductively so once you to that inductively so once you to that inductively so once you partition the rest of the diagram into n partition the rest of the diagram into n partition the rest of the diagram into n minus disjoint partitions then you can
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,55:42,55:50,minus disjoint partitions then you can minus disjoint partitions then you can add the maximal elements that you have add the maximal elements that you have add the maximal elements that you have removed in the first step and once again removed in the first step and once again removed in the first step and once again the basis will be formed by the
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,55:50,55:57,the basis will be formed by the the basis will be formed by the singleton set or the partial orders in singleton set or the partial orders in singleton set or the partial orders in which there is a chain of length at most which there is a chain of length at most
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,55:57,56:09,which there is a chain of length at most one as a corollary we find that for a one as a corollary we find that for a one as a corollary we find that for a posit p n less than or equal to posit p n less than or equal to

220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,56:58,57:02,so let us contradict the assumption that there is a chain of length n plus so there is a chain of length n plus so there is a chain of length n plus so let us say the longest chain has a let us say the longest chain has a
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,57:02,57:40,let us say the longest chain has a length of n at the most then we can length of n at the most then we can length of n at the most then we can partition this into at most n disjoint antichains so into at most n disjoint antichains so this is a partial partition of the given
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,57:40,57:48,this is a partial partition of the given this is a partial partition of the given set we are partitioning it into at most set we are partitioning it into at most set we are partitioning it into at most n disjoint antichains if no antichain n disjoint antichains if no antichain
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,57:48,58:02,n disjoint antichains if no antichain has n plus elements then each and each has n plus elements then each and each has n plus elements then each and each chain has at most chain has at most chain has at most mm elements so the number of elements mm elements so the number of elements
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,58:02,58:10,mm elements so the number of elements would be less than or equal to m into n would be less than or equal to m into n would be less than or equal to m into n which is a contradiction because we have which is a contradiction because we have
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,58:10,58:44,which is a contradiction because we have assumed that we have m n plus elements assumed that we have m n plus elements assumed that we have m n plus elements so as an example consider women among them there are three women who among them there are three women who form a grandmother mother daughter
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,58:44,58:54,form a grandmother mother daughter form a grandmother mother daughter triplet so that is a chain of triplet so that is a chain of triplet so that is a chain of descendants of length three so among descendants of length three so among descendants of length three so among these three women either there are three
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,58:54,59:12,these three women either there are three these three women either there are three women that form a grandmother mother women that form a grandmother mother women that form a grandmother mother daughter triplet or there are three daughter triplet or there are three daughter triplet or there are three women none of whom is a daughter of
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,59:12,59:30,women none of whom is a daughter of women none of whom is a daughter of another there are three women none of whom is a there are three women none of whom is a descendent of another among those three descendent of another among those three descendent of another among those three thats because ten equal to into
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,59:30,59:36,thats because ten equal to into thats because ten equal to into plus so we take n equal to and ma n plus so we take n equal to and ma n plus so we take n equal to and ma n equal to and m equal to here and
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,59:36,59:44,equal to and m equal to here and equal to and m equal to here and from the corollary we find that among from the corollary we find that among from the corollary we find that among women one of these two possibilities women one of these two possibilities women one of these two possibilities must hold so that is it from this
220.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,59:44,59:53,must hold so that is it from this must hold so that is it from this lecture hope to see you in the next lecture hope to see you in the next lecture hope to see you in the next thank you

224.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,10:32,10:42,this equation in this equation on either side of the equality we have a product side of the equality we have a product side of the equality we have a product so let us cancel the common factors from so let us cancel the common factors from so let us cancel the common factors from both sides since these two prime
224.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,10:42,10:56,both sides since these two prime both sides since these two prime factorizations are distinct everything factorizations are distinct everything factorizations are distinct everything will not cancel out so finally we will will not cancel out so finally we will will not cancel out so finally we will be left with some k primes
224.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,10:56,11:06,be left with some k primes be left with some k primes on the left side and some l primes on on the left side and some l primes on on the left side and some l primes on the right side so there will be now no the right side so there will be now no
224.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,11:06,11:11,the right side so there will be now no common prime on the left side and the common prime on the left side and the common prime on the left side and the right side every prime on the left side right side every prime on the left side right side every prime on the left side will be distinct from the primes on the
224.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,11:11,11:21,will be distinct from the primes on the will be distinct from the primes on the right side now in particular consider r right side now in particular consider r right side now in particular consider r and the righthand side s through sl and the righthand side s through sl
224.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,11:21,11:30,and the righthand side s through sl we know that r divides s through sl we know that r divides s through sl we know that r divides s through sl thats because r multiplied by a patru thats because r multiplied by a patru thats because r multiplied by a patru rk is s through vessel so there is an
224.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,11:30,11:34,rk is s through vessel so there is an rk is s through vessel so there is an integer so that r into that integer is integer so that r into that integer is integer so that r into that integer is the righthand side so r divides the the righthand side so r divides the
224.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,11:34,11:52,the righthand side so r divides the righthand side but then by theorem our one divides this one or our one our one divides this one or our one divides us two and so on divides us two and so on divides us two and so on it should divide one of the primes at
224.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,11:52,11:58,it should divide one of the primes at it should divide one of the primes at least one of the primes from the right least one of the primes from the right least one of the primes from the right hand side now r is a prime and if r
224.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,11:58,12:08,hand side now r is a prime and if r hand side now r is a prime and if r divides s which is also a prime s is divides s which is also a prime s is divides s which is also a prime s is also a prime then r equal to s so r
224.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,12:08,12:11,also a prime then r equal to s so r also a prime then r equal to s so r must equal one of the primes on the must equal one of the primes on the must equal one of the primes on the righthand side which is a contradiction
224.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,12:11,12:23,righthand side which is a contradiction righthand side which is a contradiction thats because we have already cancelled thats because we have already cancelled thats because we have already cancelled all the primes that appear on both sides all the primes that appear on both sides all the primes that appear on both sides so here we get a contradiction therefore
224.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,12:23,12:38,so here we get a contradiction therefore so here we get a contradiction therefore the two prime factorizations that we the two prime factorizations that we the two prime factorizations that we began with cannot be distinct in other began with cannot be distinct in other began with cannot be distinct in other words every number n has a unique

224.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,16:53,17:01,therefore c is closed under addition and in the case of multiplication we have a in the case of multiplication we have a in the case of multiplication we have a plus i root b into c plus i root d plus i root b into c plus i root d

224.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,19:26,19:37,see the norm of n into n is the norm of n into the norm of n so if you of n into the norm of n so if you of n into the norm of n so if you consider a composite number it consider a composite number it
224.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,19:37,20:28,consider a composite number it factorizes into factors of smaller now greater than zero and a proper complex greater than zero and a proper complex number in c which means in this b is not equal to which means in this b is not equal to zero has a norm greater than or equal to
224.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,20:28,20:42,zero has a norm greater than or equal to zero has a norm greater than or equal to so even if b equal to the i root b so even if b equal to the i root b so even if b equal to the i root b part will contribute to the normal so
224.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,20:42,20:54,part will contribute to the normal so part will contribute to the normal so norm will be greater than or equal to norm will be greater than or equal to norm will be greater than or equal to so in the system is a prime because so in the system is a prime because
224.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,20:54,21:20,so in the system is a prime because doesnt have real factors so if has doesnt have real factors so if has doesnt have real factors so if has factors n and n then n and n are factors n and n then n and n are factors n and n then n and n are complex or proper complex numbers
224.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,21:20,21:29,which means the norm of n is greater which means the norm of n is greater than or equal to six and the norm of n than or equal to six and the norm of n than or equal to six and the norm of n is also greater than or equal to six but
224.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,21:29,21:40,is also greater than or equal to six but is also greater than or equal to six but the norm of five alone is therefore the norm of five alone is therefore the norm of five alone is therefore we have that greater than or equal to we have that greater than or equal to
224.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,21:40,21:55,we have that greater than or equal to into which is which is a into which is which is a into which is which is a contradiction therefore five cannot be expressed as n therefore five cannot be expressed as n into n where n and n are both into n where n and n are both
224.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,21:55,22:03,into n where n and n are both complex numbers belonging to c therefore complex numbers belonging to c therefore complex numbers belonging to c therefore is a prime that means there are prime is a prime that means there are prime is a prime that means there are prime numbers in the system now consider

224.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,22:34,22:44,so now we find that has two prime factorizations factorizations factorizations so in within the system again there are so in within the system again there are so in within the system again there are numbers with multiple canonical prime numbers with multiple canonical prime numbers with multiple canonical prime factorizations but then what we find is
224.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,22:44,22:50,factorizations but then what we find is factorizations but then what we find is that within the system of integers there that within the system of integers there that within the system of integers there is a unique prime factorization that is is a unique prime factorization that is is a unique prime factorization that is what the fundamental theorem of

224.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,23:10,23:22,since the prime factorization is unique since the prime factorization is unique this is well defined exponent of ap is this is well defined exponent of ap is this is well defined exponent of ap is well defined well defined well defined therefore now number a can be expressed therefore now number a can be expressed
224.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,23:22,23:42,therefore now number a can be expressed as the product or all primes p of p as the product or all primes p of p as the product or all primes p of p power x pause it every individual a can be expressed as a every individual a can be expressed as a product in this fashion now let us say

224.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,30:51,30:55,so there are only our primes and when so there are only our primes and when they are listed in increasing order they they are listed in increasing order they they are listed in increasing order they are p through p arms so pr is the are p through p arms so pr is the
224.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,30:55,31:06,are p through p arms so pr is the largest prime let us say so let us largest prime let us say so let us largest prime let us say so let us consider integer n which is the product consider integer n which is the product consider integer n which is the product p through pr then we find that p
224.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,31:06,31:13,p through pr then we find that p p through pr then we find that p does not divide n because n is mod p does not divide n because n is mod p does not divide n because n is mod p that is when n is divided by p we will
224.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,31:13,31:21,that is when n is divided by p we will that is when n is divided by p we will get a remainder of similarly p also get a remainder of similarly p also get a remainder of similarly p also does not divide n p divides p does not divide n p divides p
224.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,31:21,31:32,does not divide n p divides p through p r therefore n is not divisible through p r therefore n is not divisible through p r therefore n is not divisible by p similarly none of these primes by p similarly none of these primes by p similarly none of these primes would divide men so primes p through
224.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,31:32,31:46,would divide men so primes p through would divide men so primes p through p r do not divide n therefore either n p r do not divide n therefore either n p r do not divide n therefore either n is prime which is a contradiction because we which is a contradiction because we assume that p through p are are the
224.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,31:46,31:51,assume that p through p are are the assume that p through p are are the only primes now n is a number which is only primes now n is a number which is only primes now n is a number which is larger than p r therefore this cannot be
224.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,31:51,32:09,larger than p r therefore this cannot be larger than p r therefore this cannot be or n has a prime factor other than p through pr which again is other than p through pr which again is a contradiction because we have assumed a contradiction because we have assumed
224.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,32:09,32:17,a contradiction because we have assumed that pr is the largest prime and p that pr is the largest prime and p that pr is the largest prime and p through pr are the only prime survey through pr are the only prime survey through pr are the only prime survey labelled so if n has a prime factor then
224.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,32:17,32:22,labelled so if n has a prime factor then labelled so if n has a prime factor then it must be a prime which is larger than it must be a prime which is larger than it must be a prime which is larger than pr so either way we are finding a prime
224.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,32:22,32:27,pr so either way we are finding a prime pr so either way we are finding a prime which is larger than pr which is a which is larger than pr which is a which is larger than pr which is a contradiction so either we get a contradiction so either we get a
224.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,32:27,32:37,contradiction so either we get a contradiction therefore there is no contradiction therefore there is no contradiction therefore there is no largest prime we can keep on finding largest prime we can keep on finding largest prime we can keep on finding larger primes but then how dense are larger primes but then how dense are
224.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,32:37,33:29,larger primes but then how dense are the primes the next theorem says that there are arbitrarily long gaps in the there are arbitrarily long gaps in the series of primes in other words for any integer k there in other words for any integer k there exist k consecutive integers

225.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,40:47,41:08,would be the cardinality of this which is p minus therefore plugging this in is p minus therefore plugging this in is p minus therefore plugging this in eulers generalization we find that a eulers generalization we find that a eulers generalization we find that a power p minus is mod p
225.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,41:08,41:24,this is precisely what for maps theorem this is precisely what for maps theorem says so for match theorem can be says so for match theorem can be says so for match theorem can be obtained as a corollary of eulers obtained as a corollary of eulers obtained as a corollary of eulers theorem so that is it from this lecture
225.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Benny George and  Prof. Sajith Gopalan,NPTEL,41:24,41:30,theorem so that is it from this lecture theorem so that is it from this lecture hope to see you in the next thank you
