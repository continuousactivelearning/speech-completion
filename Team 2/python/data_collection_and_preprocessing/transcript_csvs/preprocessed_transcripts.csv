166.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:37,0:39,so why am i stating all these things you so why am i stating all these things you will soon see
167.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:05,0:14,it is only straightforward to observe it is only straightforward to observe what is happening here from the sec a to what is happening here from the sec a to what is happening here from the sec a to be you observed that it was x for every be you observed that it was x for every
167.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:14,0:24,be you observed that it was x for every element you multiplied it by and he element you multiplied it by and he element you multiplied it by and he got an element on this side for sexy and got an element on this side for sexy and got an element on this side for sexy and d it was the square right so went to
167.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:24,0:35,d it was the square right so went to d it was the square right so went to square is mapped to square square is mapped to square square is mapped to square corresponds to square to square corresponds to square to square corresponds to square to square to square and v v square which is
169.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:04,0:13,let us define what a function is let us define what a function is formally you saw a couple of examples formally you saw a couple of examples formally you saw a couple of examples right in fact many examples lets take right in fact many examples lets take right in fact many examples lets take the examples that we told you just now
169.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:13,0:22,the examples that we told you just now the examples that we told you just now of abc and d from a to b there is an of abc and d from a to b there is an of abc and d from a to b there is an association of every element to a unique
169.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:22,0:28,association of every element to a unique association of every element to a unique element on this side right so zero is element on this side right so zero is element on this side right so zero is associated with zero one was associated associated with zero one was associated
169.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:28,0:38,associated with zero one was associated with one im sorry with one im sorry with one im sorry to two was mapped to to to and to two was mapped to to to and to two was mapped to to to and to right you see this is called a
169.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:38,0:45,to right you see this is called a to right you see this is called a function second example the mapping was function second example the mapping was function second example the mapping was in general a term x going to x square in general a term x going to x square
169.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:45,0:53,in general a term x going to x square correct correct correct so by a function we mean something that so by a function we mean something that so by a function we mean something that maps elements of the left left side to maps elements of the left left side to
169.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:53,0:57,maps elements of the left left side to unique elements of the right side
170.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:07,0:12,by unique i mean an element this side is by unique i mean an element this side is mapped to an element this side it mapped to an element this side it mapped to an element this side it doesnt so happen but an element on this doesnt so happen but an element on this
170.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:12,0:21,doesnt so happen but an element on this side gets mapped to two elements this side gets mapped to two elements this side gets mapped to two elements this side that is not allowed however two side that is not allowed however two side that is not allowed however two elements on the left can get mapped to
170.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:21,0:25,elements on the left can get mapped to elements on the left can get mapped to one element on the right
171.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:05,0:14,in mathematics one thing that in mathematics one thing that complicates the subject is heavy usage complicates the subject is heavy usage complicates the subject is heavy usage of notations and definitions although it of notations and definitions although it of notations and definitions although it is possible for us to illustrate things
171.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:14,0:22,is possible for us to illustrate things is possible for us to illustrate things with examples and intuitive explanations with examples and intuitive explanations with examples and intuitive explanations it is difficult for us to keep doing it it is difficult for us to keep doing it it is difficult for us to keep doing it as we advance the subject we have been
171.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:22,0:30,as we advance the subject we have been as we advance the subject we have been giving you examples for functions and giving you examples for functions and giving you examples for functions and related topics in plain english but now related topics in plain english but now related topics in plain english but now we have reached that point where we
171.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:30,0:36,we have reached that point where we we have reached that point where we cannot go ahead without defining a few cannot go ahead without defining a few cannot go ahead without defining a few things so bear with me i need to define things so bear with me i need to define
171.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:36,0:43,things so bear with me i need to define a few things and develop the notations a few things and develop the notations a few things and develop the notations that will that well be using for the that will that well be using for the that will that well be using for the rest of the chapter there is not much of
171.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:43,0:47,rest of the chapter there is not much of rest of the chapter there is not much of definitions beyond what i am going to definitions beyond what i am going to definitions beyond what i am going to say right now it is only these four to say right now it is only these four to
171.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:47,0:57,say right now it is only these four to five concepts so listen carefully you five concepts so listen carefully you five concepts so listen carefully you will soon get used to these notations so will soon get used to these notations so will soon get used to these notations so firstly let me take an example of a
171.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:57,1:04,firstly let me take an example of a firstly let me take an example of a function f from some set x to some other function f from some set x to some other function f from some set x to some other set y and this set is called the domain
171.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:04,1:15,set y and this set is called the domain set y and this set is called the domain and varied x is called the codomain for and varied x is called the codomain for and varied x is called the codomain for example if i were to take a function f
171.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:15,1:28,example if i were to take a function f example if i were to take a function f from lets say integers two positive from lets say integers two positive from lets say integers two positive integers okay integers okay integers okay i also include zero here lets say okay
171.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:28,1:35,i also include zero here lets say okay i also include zero here lets say okay defined by f of x is equal to x square defined by f of x is equal to x square defined by f of x is equal to x square okay so my domain here is going to be
171.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:35,1:40,okay so my domain here is going to be okay so my domain here is going to be the hole of z which includes positive or the hole of z which includes positive or the hole of z which includes positive or negative integers let me write that down negative integers let me write that down
171.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:40,1:51,negative integers let me write that down minus minus so on plus plus minus minus so on plus plus minus minus so on plus plus and so on alright and then i am defining and so on alright and then i am defining and so on alright and then i am defining a function f which takes all these
171.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:51,2:05,a function f which takes all these a function f which takes all these elements to its square and minus goes elements to its square and minus goes elements to its square and minus goes to minus goes to goes to plus to minus goes to goes to plus to minus goes to goes to plus goes to plus goes to and so on
171.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:05,2:12,goes to plus goes to and so on goes to plus goes to and so on correct the function is f of x is equal correct the function is f of x is equal correct the function is f of x is equal to x square so now this is called the
171.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:12,2:20,to x square so now this is called the to x square so now this is called the domain this is called the domain this is called the domain this is called the codomain and as you can see not every codomain and as you can see not every codomain and as you can see not every element in codomain is being mapped by
171.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:20,2:27,element in codomain is being mapped by element in codomain is being mapped by an element of domain for example there an element of domain for example there an element of domain for example there is no element that goes to three you can is no element that goes to three you can
171.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:27,2:34,is no element that goes to three you can always say root three the square of root always say root three the square of root always say root three the square of root is but then that root is not is but then that root is not is but then that root is not included in the domain you see so root
171.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:34,2:40,included in the domain you see so root included in the domain you see so root is not there and hence is not being is not there and hence is not being is not there and hence is not being mapped by any element do you see that mapped by any element do you see that
171.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:40,2:48,mapped by any element do you see that the subset of this co domain is being the subset of this co domain is being the subset of this co domain is being mapped by some elements of the domain mapped by some elements of the domain mapped by some elements of the domain and that subset is what goes by the name
171.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:48,2:57,and that subset is what goes by the name and that subset is what goes by the name range by range we mean a range of values range by range we mean a range of values range by range we mean a range of values that the function f takes so you you now
171.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:57,3:05,that the function f takes so you you now that the function f takes so you you now know whats a domain whats a co domain know whats a domain whats a co domain know whats a domain whats a co domain and what is a range you say to be an
171.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:05,3:15,and what is a range you say to be an and what is a range you say to be an image of the element and is a pre image of the element and is a pre image of the element and is a pre image of is an image of file and
171.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:15,3:19,image of is an image of file and image of is an image of file and is the pre image of
172.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:05,0:13,you all know about relations now you you all know about relations now you know its a function what is the know its a function what is the know its a function what is the difference is there a difference in the difference is there a difference in the difference is there a difference in the first place yes there is
172.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:13,0:19,first place yes there is first place yes there is well see what exactly is the difference well see what exactly is the difference well see what exactly is the difference between a relation and a function
173.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:05,0:11,now that you know what is a function you now that you know what is a function you must be wondering the difference between must be wondering the difference between must be wondering the difference between relations and functions with this relations and functions with this relations and functions with this example things will become clear
173.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:11,0:18,example things will become clear example things will become clear consider this mapping from the set of consider this mapping from the set of consider this mapping from the set of all real numbers to the set of all real all real numbers to the set of all real all real numbers to the set of all real numbers defined as f of x is equal to
173.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:18,0:25,numbers defined as f of x is equal to numbers defined as f of x is equal to root x please wait is this even a root x please wait is this even a root x please wait is this even a function definitely no because it function definitely no because it
173.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:25,0:31,function definitely no because it violates the rule of the function and violates the rule of the function and violates the rule of the function and what is the rule one element cannot be what is the rule one element cannot be what is the rule one element cannot be mapped to two elements so what is
173.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:31,0:42,mapped to two elements so what is mapped to two elements so what is happening here happening here happening here four is mapped to plus and minus and four is mapped to plus and minus and four is mapped to plus and minus and hence it is not a function but please
173.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:42,0:48,hence it is not a function but please hence it is not a function but please note it is certainly a relation why note it is certainly a relation why note it is certainly a relation why because a relation is just a subset of r because a relation is just a subset of r
173.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:48,0:59,because a relation is just a subset of r cross r and hence will be considering cross r and hence will be considering cross r and hence will be considering the set where a number comma its root is the set where a number comma its root is the set where a number comma its root is there and hence it is a relation but not
173.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:59,1:05,there and hence it is a relation but not there and hence it is a relation but not a function so the most important point a function so the most important point a function so the most important point is every function is a relation but not is every function is a relation but not
173.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:05,1:08,is every function is a relation but not every relation is a function

179.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:21,0:26,goes to goes to and so on goes to goes to and so on there is no other number x belonging to there is no other number x belonging to there is no other number x belonging to the natural number which is mapped to the natural number which is mapped to
179.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:26,0:37,the natural number which is mapped to only is mapped to similarly only only is mapped to similarly only only is mapped to similarly only is mapped to but how do we prove that is mapped to but how do we prove that is mapped to but how do we prove that its a fun one function so let us check
179.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:37,0:45,its a fun one function so let us check its a fun one function so let us check consider the two natural numbers x and consider the two natural numbers x and consider the two natural numbers x and x so f of x is equal to x and f
179.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:45,0:50,x so f of x is equal to x and f x so f of x is equal to x and f of x is equal to x we have seen of x is equal to x we have seen of x is equal to x we have seen the proof technique right
179.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:50,0:58,the proof technique right the proof technique right i assume x is equal to x what do i assume x is equal to x what do i assume x is equal to x what do i get after canceling the twos x is i get after canceling the twos x is
179.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:58,1:11,i get after canceling the twos x is equal to x which means if in case x equal to x which means if in case x equal to x which means if in case x becomes equal to x then x is becomes equal to x then x is becomes equal to x then x is equal to x and hence f is always a
179.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:11,1:24,equal to x and hence f is always a equal to x and hence f is always a function the next example consider f function the next example consider f function the next example consider f from real numbers to real numbers from real numbers to real numbers from real numbers to real numbers defined us f of x is equal to minus x
179.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:24,1:39,f of is f of is f of is f of is f of is f of is minus f of is and so on how do we minus f of is and so on how do we minus f of is and so on how do we prove this is a function let x and
179.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:39,1:46,prove this is a function let x and prove this is a function let x and x be two real numbers f of x is x be two real numbers f of x is x be two real numbers f of x is minus x and f of x is minus x i
179.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:46,1:52,minus x and f of x is minus x i minus x and f of x is minus x i assume f of x is equal to f of x and assume f of x is equal to f of x and assume f of x is equal to f of x and hence minus x is equal to minus x
179.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:52,1:59,hence minus x is equal to minus x hence minus x is equal to minus x cancelling on both the sides give me cancelling on both the sides give me cancelling on both the sides give me x is equal to x which contradicts x is equal to x which contradicts
179.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:59,2:09,x is equal to x which contradicts our assumption and hence f is so our assumption and hence f is so our assumption and hence f is so what do i assume every time i assume what do i assume every time i assume what do i assume every time i assume that x and x are different but f of
179.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:09,2:15,that x and x are different but f of that x and x are different but f of x and f of x are the same and hence x and f of x are the same and hence x and f of x are the same and hence i arrived at the contradiction the last
179.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:15,2:22,i arrived at the contradiction the last i arrived at the contradiction the last example consider this function from real example consider this function from real example consider this function from real numbers to integers defined as f of x is numbers to integers defined as f of x is
179.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:22,2:30,numbers to integers defined as f of x is equal to square bracket x which means it equal to square bracket x which means it equal to square bracket x which means it is the greatest integer function what is is the greatest integer function what is is the greatest integer function what is a greatest integer function what do i
179.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:30,2:41,a greatest integer function what do i a greatest integer function what do i get after applying the function it is get after applying the function it is get after applying the function it is the greatest integer less than or equal the greatest integer less than or equal the greatest integer less than or equal to this x so f of is the greatest
179.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:41,2:48,to this x so f of is the greatest to this x so f of is the greatest integer which is less than is zero integer which is less than is zero integer which is less than is zero and hence i take it as f of point and hence i take it as f of point
179.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:48,3:01,and hence i take it as f of point is f of point is also f is f of point is also f is f of point is also f of point is also and so on you of point is also and so on you of point is also and so on you observe here i am getting thrice for
179.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:01,3:10,observe here i am getting thrice for observe here i am getting thrice for every value between amp every value between amp every value between amp i will get it as hence f is not we i will get it as hence f is not we i will get it as hence f is not we need not prove since we have arrived at
179.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:10,3:16,need not prove since we have arrived at need not prove since we have arrived at a counter example which says that f is a counter example which says that f is a counter example which says that f is not
180.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:07,0:15,a question to you all assume you are a question to you all assume you are given two finite sets a and b and a given two finite sets a and b and a given two finite sets a and b and a function f from a to b which is given to
180.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:15,0:24,function f from a to b which is given to function f from a to b which is given to be the question is what can you say be the question is what can you say be the question is what can you say about the cardinalities of a and b here
185.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:03,0:24,we are now going to see some examples of onto functions consider this function f from the set of all natural numbers to the set of all natural numbers defined as f of x is equal to x this function where x goes to x is called as the identify function
185.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:24,0:47,so let me start enumerating f of is f of is f of is f of is and so on each number is mapped to itself so i have to find out if this function is onto or not consider any element y belonging to the codomain codomain is the set of all natural numbers
185.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:47,1:14,what will be its preimage we see that the preimage is the number itself y will be mapped to y itself and hence every element in the codomain has the same element as its preimage in the domain and hence f is onto consider this function f from the set of all integers to the set of all integers defined
185.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:14,1:47,as f of x is equal to mod x the modulus function how is it defined f of will be that is mod is f of is f of is because mod of is f of is f of is and so on you see and are both mapped to the same element
185.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:47,2:16,and the same goes with and both of them are mapped to let us observe what is the range here the range is and so on so we see that range is the set of all natural numbers but what are we given as codomain integers are codomain do you see that range is not equal to codomain
185.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:16,2:41,and hence f is not onto because we know that if f is onto codomain has to be equal to range consider this function f f is defined from the set of all whole numbers to the set of all whole numbers defined as f of x is equal to x if x is odd and x if x is even
185.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:41,3:01,do you see that f of x is taking two value here and it depends on what x is if x is odd it takes the value x and if x is even it takes the value x so we have a domain as whole numbers so is mapped to because is even and hence
185.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:01,3:31,is f of is mapped to f of is mapped to f of is f of is and so on do you see a pattern here all odd numbers are mapped to even numbers and all even numbers are mapped to odd numbers now let us consider an element y belonging to the core domain
185.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:31,3:49,so either it is x or x correct depending on what x is so the preimage of y is always either y or y and hence f is onto
186.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:05,0:12,what if there is a function f from a what if there is a function f from a finite set a to a finite set b and given finite set a to a finite set b and given finite set a to a finite set b and given that f is on what can you say about
186.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:12,0:15,that f is on what can you say about that f is on what can you say about the cardinality of a and b
187.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:03,0:14,now i will tell you a small instance and you tell me what you can infer there is this organization where every male in the organization is married and his wife also works in the same organization now remember something in mathematics whatever we say is all that we say
187.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:14,0:26,whatever we dont say should not be assumed for example i said every male in the office is married by that i dont mean that every female in the office is married i am not saying that if you see a male you must know that that male is married
187.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:26,0:38,not only that that persons wife is also in the same office then what can we say about the number of males and number of females in the office think about it so the number of males if i put them in a domain and call it m and number of females
187.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:38,0:47,if i put them in set and call it f my function f will be from male m to lets not call it f lets call it w man to woman alright so f of an element here will simply take you to his wife what can you say about the organization here
187.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:47,1:03,i can say that the number of males here is certainly less than or equal to number of women here why why because according to what i said i repeat i said every man here in this organization is both married as well as his wife works in the same organization
187.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:03,1:24,this implies that no man is single and no mans wife it doesnt so happen that she is not in the organization a man is married and his wife is also in the same organization note i am not talking a thing about a woman here who may be single
187.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:24,1:41,i have never said anything about the woman here correct so there could be a single woman so all that you can infer is that this is oneone function because in our country in fact many countries a person cannot be married to two people simultaneously correct so a person here has a unique woman as his wife and hence the function is oneone function
187.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:41,1:55,when the function is oneone the codomain may have some left overs and we can only conclude that the number of elements in m is less than or equal to number of elements in w so what is the moral of this video clip we are trying to say that whenever there is a function f from a domain to a codomain
187.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:55,2:09,which is oneone we can sure that the number of elements in the codomain will be equal to or greater than the number of elements in the domain now this is a very important fact you may want to make a note of it and you may want to use this in solving some questions that can come by your way
188.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:06,0:12,there is one type of function that is there is one type of function that is very important to us in the whole of very important to us in the whole of very important to us in the whole of this subject and that is this function this subject and that is this function

194.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:16,0:23,are there infinitely many doesnt look like it right i mean it looks like you like it right i mean it looks like you like it right i mean it looks like you can you can compute the total number of can you can compute the total number of can you can compute the total number of functions by simply exhausting all
194.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:23,0:29,functions by simply exhausting all functions by simply exhausting all of them correct so as an example if you of them correct so as an example if you of them correct so as an example if you say lets have some xy like this say lets have some xy like this
194.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:29,0:42,say lets have some xy like this the only possible functions are this the only possible functions are this the only possible functions are this and xy going to correct these are and xy going to correct these are and xy going to correct these are the only two possibilities right so they
194.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:42,0:49,the only two possibilities right so they the only two possibilities right so they are not infinitely many they are are not infinitely many they are are not infinitely many they are finitely many but what are those for finitely many but what are those for finitely many but what are those for this this example of abcd going to
194.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:49,0:55,this this example of abcd going to this this example of abcd going to  how many possible functions can you how many possible functions can you how many possible functions can you think of think about it
195.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:03,0:28,so given lets say a b c and how many possible oneone functions can you think of let me enumerate this properly how will i do this i will simply write a b c and below a b c i will write the mapping a goes to b goes to c goes to another
195.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:28,0:53,way is a b c go into lets a got to b goes to and c goes to now i again write this as if you know what i mean correct i simply write a goes to i write below a now do you observe something you must be smart enough
195.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:53,1:32,to observe that all i am doing here is writing all possible permutations of so on how many are there lets enumerate all of them you have precisely six of them a better way to say it a smarter way to say it is there are three factorial of them so total possible oneone function from abc to
195.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:32,1:53,this question boils down to asking this question of in how many ways can you arrange all possible permutations happens to be as i told you three factorial and now thats the answer perfect so now lets go ahead and ask a slightly more complicated question than this
196.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:05,0:17,let us now look at a slightly involved let us now look at a slightly involved problem in how many ways can i consider problem in how many ways can i consider problem in how many ways can i consider all possible functions from abcd all possible functions from abcd

196.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:27,0:40,going to be factorial going to be factorial now what if i increase this to and ask now what if i increase this to and ask now what if i increase this to and ask this question how many functions are this question how many functions are this question how many functions are there from abcd now a can
196.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:40,0:47,there from abcd now a can there from abcd now a can go to b can go to c can go to to be go to b can go to c can go to to be go to b can go to c can go to to be can go to again lets use the same
196.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:47,1:04,can go to again lets use the same can go to again lets use the same trick below abcd you will write what trick below abcd you will write what trick below abcd you will write what and which corresponds to this and which corresponds to this and which corresponds to this function correct now if you see the
196.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:04,1:17,function correct now if you see the function correct now if you see the question of how many functions are question of how many functions are question of how many functions are there from abcd boils down there from abcd boils down there from abcd boils down to simply writing abcd and simply
196.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:17,1:30,to simply writing abcd and simply to simply writing abcd and simply picking some for different numbers from picking some for different numbers from picking some for different numbers from and putting them here and putting them here and putting them here was one such way is another was one such way is another

198.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:30,0:36,just now told you that whenever there is just now told you that whenever there is a bijection m becomes equal to n the a bijection m becomes equal to n the a bijection m becomes equal to n the number of elements here will be equal to number of elements here will be equal to
198.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:36,0:42,number of elements here will be equal to number of elements here correct so what number of elements here correct so what number of elements here correct so what is that number what are the total is that number what are the total is that number what are the total possible by directions from our domain
198.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:42,0:51,possible by directions from our domain possible by directions from our domain to codomain if the domain contains lets to codomain if the domain contains lets to codomain if the domain contains lets say m elements its going to be m say m elements its going to be m say m elements its going to be m factorial why is that we saw that the

208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:38,2:43,function from r to r defined as f of x function from r to r defined as f of x is equal to x by so i am taking the is equal to x by so i am taking the is equal to x by so i am taking the half of that element each time what is
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:43,2:50,half of that element each time what is half of that element each time what is the inverse here f of x is y so what the inverse here f of x is y so what the inverse here f of x is y so what does y equal to x by and therefore
208.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:50,3:01,does y equal to x by and therefore does y equal to x by and therefore what is x very simple it is y right what is x very simple it is y right what is x very simple it is y right so f inverse y happens to be y
