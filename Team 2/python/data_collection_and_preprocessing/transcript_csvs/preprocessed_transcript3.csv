230.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,0:27,1:05,in this lecture we will see a very useful principle from combinatorics known as pigeonhole principle the principle is extremely simple so simple that it is difficult to imagine that this can be of use okay the principle is very simple to state suppose you have n objects say n balls and they are distributed into k bins if n is
230.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,1:05,1:41,greater than k then there will exist a bin with more than ball so that is the principle so if you have n balls and they are distributed into k bins where n is greater than k then there will be a bin at least bin which has more than one ball it is almost selfevident
230.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,1:41,1:58,if the number of bins is small and if all of them had less than or equal to one ball then the total number of balls is going to be only it is going to be less than or equal to k but the number of balls is greater than k and therefore the statement must be true
230.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,1:58,2:17,so let us let us see some applications of this so pigeonhole principle of course is very simple to state the power of this principle comes from the wide variety of ways in which you can set up balls and bins so let us look at a problem which can be solved
230.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,2:17,2:59,using pigeonhole principle so let us look at this sequence so consider this following sequence consisting of numbers and so on so the ith element of the sequence would be and so on i times now let us look at the theorem or the result states that there will surely be an element in the sequence which is divisible by let us say
230.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,2:59,3:34,ok so one element is this there will be an element in the sequence which is divisible by now how do we prove this what is the method is this first of all is this statement even be true why should there be an element in the sequence consisting of s
230.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,3:34,3:52,the ith element being repeated i times so one of this is going to be divisible by the number there is nothing sacrosanct about there is a wide you can substitute it with a lot of other numbers the few numbers that you cannot you can look at the proof
230.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,3:52,4:10,carefully to figure out what all numbers can come in place of so let us try and work out a proof for this so we will set up the balls and bins in a certain way such that we can argue that there will be a bin which contains more than one
230.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,4:10,4:40,ball and that is going to be used to construct the proof of divisibility so here one of these numbers to be divisible by so what we can do is try and divide these numbers by you will get infinitely many numbers so let us just take let us say elements of the sequence so and so on we will look at the first
230.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,4:40,5:08,elements of this sequence and divide each one of them by you will get some remainder ok if any one of them is then we know that we have some numbers in the sequence which is divisible by what if none of them is so that is the case that we are interested
230.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,5:08,5:57,so let us write down the steps consider the first elements of the sequence so divide the elements by and note the remainder if any of the remainders were then we have done we have a proof that look one of the we have an element which is divisible by so we may assume that all the remainders
230.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,5:57,6:40,we get are numbers between and so remainders are between both numbers inclusive  so these are numbers the remainders and we have numbers in total so if you denote the remainder by r r so on these are remainders and each of them is one of these numbers between and so one of these remainders must repeat so
230.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,6:40,7:17,let us say a i leaves remainder r i and a j where j is greater than i leaves remainder r j so we have this case that r i is equal to r j so what we have is a i is equal to some number k into plus r i and a j also has a similar equation this is equal
230.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,7:17,7:52,to k into plus r j we have r i and r j as the same and therefore if you do a j minus a i what we will get is k minus k into ok now this therefore must divide a i minus a j we are almost done what we wanted to show is there is an element in the sequence which
230.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,7:52,8:27,is divisible by and not the difference of two elements but this is good enough for us because what is a i minus a j so if you look at a j a j is equal to j times and a i is equal to i times if you subtract them what you get is a j minus a i that is going to be and the
230.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,8:27,9:01,last items are going to be so this is equal to a j minus i which will consist of j minus i s into to the power i because there are i s this equation is true so we can write k minus k into is equal to a j minus i into power i so now if
230.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,9:01,9:26,you look at does not have any common factor with power i because the only factors of power i are and the only prime factors of power i are going to be and and they do not appear in so must divide a j minus i and a j minus i is one of the elements in the sequence
230.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,9:26,9:55,ok so we can say therefore a j minus i is the required element so that was one application of pigeonhole principle so the balls are the pigeons where the remainder that is left by each element of the sequence when divided by and the pigeonholes are the bins where
230.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,9:55,10:34,numbers from to we took remainders to fit in bins so now let us see another application of pigeonhole principle its a little more involved application so here we start with a with an irrational number so let us say e you can replace it with any other irrational number and we consider its multiples so e e e and so on so
230.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,10:34,10:53,this is the sequence that we are considering instead of the irrational number if you had started off with a rational number then we know that at some point of time we will get an integer when we start with an irrational number and if you consider this sequence e
230.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,10:53,11:19,to e and so on the multiples of e so we know that none of these elements in the sequence is going to be equal to an integer but what we will show is one of these elements is going to be arbitrarily close to an integer there will be some element which is you give a measure of closeness one of those elements
230.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,11:19,11:42,is going to be arbitrarily close to some integer so we will make the i mean we will make the statement little more concrete so let us say a degree of closeness we will call this to the power minus so we will what we want to so this is what is delta
230.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,11:42,12:34,we will claim the following for some n n times e is delta close to an integer so delta close means so if i write the square bracket alpha this will denote the nearest integer to alpha and if it is exactly midway then we will choose either one of them in
230.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,12:34,13:06,that case let us say we will choose a larger one so this is the definition of the nearest integer so what we want to say is ne so ne minus ne the number minus its nearest integer its absolute value is going to be less than or equal to delta this is the claim i mean this is the definition of delta close and
230.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,13:06,13:36,what we are claiming is for some n ne is delta close to an integer so how do we prove this what should be the balls and what should be the bins so let us look at each of these elements e to e and so on here we have delta is equal
230.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,13:36,14:02,to raised to minus so by delta is what we will choose as the number of bins so we have not yet told what is the bin but the number of bins will be we are going to set up balls and bins analogy wherein the number of bins will be by delta or
230.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,14:02,14:42,raised to and we are going to look at raised to plus numbers of this sequence and each of those numbers is going to be put in one of the bins and since there are raised to bins one bin is going to be containing numbers now let us decide how we are going to put these numbers in the bins so look at any
230.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,14:42,15:11,number if you consider let us say m times e and if you look at the floor of that i mean this is going to be an integer and me minus floor of me is a number which belongs to it cannot be or so we could have said the open interval but this
230.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,15:11,15:40,is me minus floor m times e is going to be some number between and now let us just look at this interval to and split it into raised to equal parts ok so let us call this as f of m so for the mth element f of m denotes the
230.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,15:40,16:11,amount by which me exceeds the integer part of the number so f m if it now we have split this into raised to parts equal parts so each part is going to be of size raised to minus so these parts are going to be our bins and if f m falls in
230.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,16:11,16:43,one of these part then we will say that the number falls in that particular bin so if you had let us say e is approximately so look at the i mean there is some bin which contains and that will be where the first element will be there now if you take e that is going to be something like something or something so that
230.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,16:43,17:05,is going to be fall in a different bin and so on so each element we are going to put in one of these bins clearly since we took raised to plus numbers some bins is going to contain the same i mean some bins is going to contain numbers so
230.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,17:05,17:48,let us say n e and n e fall in the same bin therefore n e is equal to some integer plus let us say delta and n e is equal to k plus delta and delta and delta are numbers which fall in the same bin so if you look at n minus so let us say n is greater than n so n minus n e is
230.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,17:48,18:13,going to be k minus k that is going to be an integer let us say k plus delta minus delta now delta minus delta both these numbers by virtue of being in the same bin of size at most to the power minus their difference can be at most to
230.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,18:13,18:39,the power minus so that means n minus n times e if you call this as let us say re where r is some integer re is going to be k plus this could be negative as well so plus or minus some number epsilon where epsilon is guaranteed to be less than to
230.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,18:39,19:02,the power minus so plus or minus is there so epsilon if you assume as positive and if delta is greater than delta then we can say it is k plus the other k will say it is k minus epsilon but whatever is the case re is another element of the sequence and re is going to be some
230.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,19:02,19:42,integer plus a very small number and by very small here we mean that it is going to be less than to the minus so we have seen cases of pigeonhole principle now we will look at little more slightly more general version of pigeonhole principle so here we will say that this is a generalized pigeonhole principle so if you have let
230.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,19:42,20:14,us say n balls and k bins then one bin will have i mean at least one bin will have greater than or equal to n by k balls the same reasoning as to why pigeonhole principle is true will be the reason why the generalized pigeonhole principle is true so if we distributed n
230.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,20:14,20:43,balls into k bins then there surely should be a bin which has at least n by k balls because if all bins contain less than n by k balls then the maximum is going to be less than n by k into k which is less than n so now let us see another example involving generalized pigeonhole principle so here
230.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,20:43,21:18,we will look at an example from geometry a one sided i mean we have a square whose sides are centimeter long and we are putting let us say points place points inside s so let us call this as a square s and we are placing points inside the square
230.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,21:18,21:46,if we have large number of points then there will be points which are close to each other ok that is a general statement here we want to say that when we have points inside s there will be points so claim no matter how you place the points there will exist
230.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,21:46,22:27,which are there will points which are within cm of each other now how do we prove such a statement ok there will surely be points which are within centimeters of each other now how do we try to see this as the generalized pigeonhole principle one way to think about it would be to take let us say circles so consider
230.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,22:27,23:15,circles of diameter and if you can somehow cover the entire sphere using circles whose diameter is less than then we know that there will be points in the same circle so what we want to try and do is we want to somehow place circles or circles so that they cover the entire region
230.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,23:15,23:42,now here if you want a circle maybe that is little tricky and there is going to be lot of overlap so it is not very straight forward to see how this can be done but there is a simpler way wherein you can split it into parts so you can look at this particular
230.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,23:42,24:17,square and let us say we split it into parts natural split so it is split into squares now if you look at these squares and no matter how you place points there is going to be one particular square which contains points and the maximum distance between any points in the smaller square is going to be so smaller square is of side
230.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,24:17,24:42,by so this into root will be the maximum distance and that is something divided by that is going to be less than this is surely less than so if we have split this in this particular manner so you can get points which are within centimeters of each other
230.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,24:42,25:34,we will end our discussion on pigeonhole principle by looking at one more example so here we are looking at a combinatorial problem where we have let us say boxes and we have balls or bins and balls and we are distributing these balls into these boxes following rules the first rule no box no bin is empty the second rule no bin contains
230.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,25:34,26:08,more than let us say balls now when you distribute it in this way there are many ways of distributing it in this way when you distribute none all of those distributions would have the property that there will be a set of bins containing so when i say a set of bins containing it take all the balls
230.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,26:08,26:41,in those bins together whatever they contain so the set of bins containing balls exactly balls so no matter how you distribute the balls into bins there will be a subset of bins such that together they will account for exactly balls now suppose you had let us say balls and we had done this
230.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,26:41,27:08,we could let us say give balls in each bin and that is never going to if you distribute in that particular fashion there is no way that you can get by combining few bins so natural question would be to wonder why such a claim is true when you have balls
230.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,27:08,27:29,and boxes so we will give a proof of this via pigeonhole principle again the techniques are very similar to the techniques that we had seen we are going to now when we want to say that some bin contains balls even if we can say that some bins together
230.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,27:29,27:58,contains a multiple of balls the only allowable multiples under these conditions are and but if we skip some boxes then you are going to get something less than  so if you just say that there is a collection of bins which i mean there is a subset strict subset which contains a multiple of balls in them then that would mean that
230.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,27:58,28:33,it is exactly when we want to look at that multiple of we could try and look at the remainders the remainder of what this is where the cleverness comes in so the proof so let us look at these boxes they will contain some number let us say a a a so i denotes the number of balls in bin i we have just arranged in some particular
230.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,28:33,28:56,way ok now we will insist one thing on this arrangement we will insist that a is not equal to a can this always be done i mean if there are two bins which contain different number of balls in them we could of course get those bins and do this entire thing
230.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,28:56,29:21,so the only case where we cannot get such an arrangement is when every bin contains exactly the same number of balls but that would be the case when every bin contains exactly balls but in that case our claim is trivially true because we can just take any bins and together they are going to be ok so we will assume that is not
230.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,29:21,29:52,the case and therefore we have bins a and a which has a distinct number of balls in bin that is going to be different for the number of balls in bin and those numbers we will call it as a and a now let us consider this sequence of numbers so the first is a the next
230.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,29:52,30:21,is a plus a next is a plus a plus a and last is a plus up to a and this is going to be surely ok so let us look at these numbers and ask sorry this the last sum is going to be the total number of numbers that are there in the sequence
230.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,30:21,31:03,is so this is a sequence of numbers numbers varying from let us say a to now let us divide so let us call these numbers as let us say b b b let me consider the remainders r r r so this is b i mod there are remainders if any of these were zero then we are done so except r
230.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,31:03,31:28,the last one of course is going to be divisible by or the other so let us skip the th element we will just look at the elements lets say r so these are elements if any one of them gives a zero then we have a set of bins which contain balls so
230.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,31:28,31:56,we can assume that none of them is zero and therefore they are numbers between to if none of them is zero then they have to to now let us ask this question is there any repetitions in them there could be repetitions but that would be the good case for us so if r i equals r j that means the b i s are increasing in order ok so
230.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,31:56,32:26,if r i equals r j then b i plus is equal to b j therefore if you look at the numbers or look at the bins numbered let us say i plus to j they are going to be of sum ok so now that would validate our claim so we may assume that is also not the case
230.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,32:26,32:51,that means all these numbers are distinct and therefore they are numbers from to now what do we do ok here is where the assumption that a is not equal to a comes handy so let us look at these numbers and we will add a into the mix and if you look at a
230.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,32:51,33:33,mod that should be now you have elements a itself is not because we said that no bin contains greater than or equal to more than balls if a was exactly we have one bin with exactly there should be some sum here which is exactly equal to a so if a is added there will be a repetition and that repetition without a
230.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,33:33,33:58,there was no repetition so that sum is going to be so that remainder is going to be a and by virtue of a not equal to a so this is not equal to b it is going to be some b j therefore b j is going to be equal to plus a since b j is equal to plus
230.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,33:58,34:44,a if you look at the set consisting of all elements from to j and remove the second element we will get a set which contains exactly balls so that concludes the proof and we will stop here
231.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,0:21,0:37,music music you in todays lecture we will look at the in todays lecture we will look at the problems involved in balls and bins the problems involved in balls and bins the problems involved in balls and bins the basic question that we are trying to basic question that we are trying to

231.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,0:45,0:53,of doing this of doing this now stated in this format its a bit now stated in this format its a bit now stated in this format its a bit under specified so we could say things under specified so we could say things under specified so we could say things like the balls are distinguishable the
231.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,0:53,1:01,like the balls are distinguishable the like the balls are distinguishable the bins are distinguishable or the bins bins are distinguishable or the bins bins are distinguishable or the bins need to be nonempty in you could impose need to be nonempty in you could impose need to be nonempty in you could impose lot of conditions on how the

231.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,1:09,1:13,give us different kind of problems so give us different kind of problems so the first type of problem that we will the first type of problem that we will the first type of problem that we will discuss is counting the number of discuss is counting the number of

240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,0:28,0:51,so we will begin our study of algebraic structures with an introduction to the algebraic structure known as groups we will understand this by solving i mean we will introduce a notion of groups by solving up puzzle i will first describe a game that many of you may be familiar with
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,0:51,1:28,so this is known as the peg solitaire game so this game is a single player game and it is played on a board which looks like this so you can imagine these holes as places where a marble can be placed so the initial configuration all the positions will contain marble
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,1:28,1:53,so let us say that the darkened positions are devoid of marbles so if i mark it in black that means there is no marble at that particular position and so this is a starting configuration there are marbles at all the positions except at the very center of the board and there
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,1:53,2:17,are certain moves that is available and you can perform these moves in the board and the final configuration is given the question is whether you can reach that particular configuration so we need to describe what the moves are so center position is the only so the starting the standard starting configuration is one
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,2:17,2:37,where the center position is devoid of any marbles so let us look what is a generalized move like so let us say there are positions which are filled with marble and there is a vaccant position next to it so that these positions are one after another they are adjacent position
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,2:37,3:14,they can either be in the horizontal position so this is horizontal case or you can have an arrangement where there is a vertical alignment of positions such that of them are filled with marbles and the third one is empty so this is the vertical case so in this case what you can do is you can allow so the move is described as the left
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,3:14,3:42,most marble can jump to the vaccant position and if you jump over a marble the middle one is removed so from this configuration we will end at up at the following configuration wherein you have empty positions and position filled with a marble so basically if you name this as a b and c where a b are occupied positions and c
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,3:42,4:07,is an unoccupied position then the marble from position a can be transferred to the position c which is empty and in the process you can remove of the marble that is there at position b in case of vertical alignment also you can do the same thing so if you name these positions as alpha beta and gamma the marble at gamma can jump
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,4:07,4:25,over the marble at beta to the position alpha and in the process the marble at beta position is removed now there are other moves as well for example here the move is left to right you can have it from right to left top to bottom all those are fine
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,4:25,4:50,so basically any move is of the following kind you need to find positions of the board which are next to each other they should be consecutive positions such that the extreme positions that is if you find these consecutive positions either horizontal or vertical the middle position should surely contain a marble
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,4:50,5:20,and one of the sides should be empty in that case you can transfer the marble to the empty position and remove the other marbles so that is the move the question is if you start with a particular configuration can you reach other configuration note that any move horizontal or vertical will reduce the number of marbles on the board
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,5:20,6:09,so in this starting configuration there are along the arms there so into plus positions out of which is empty so into marbles are present that is marbles are there on the table so marbles to start with and then the question is can you reach a configuration with exactly marble
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,6:09,6:54,so you can try this out and may be after it is slightly difficult but you can figure out that there are configure you can reach a configuration where there is only marble remaining so let me just describe some configurations which you from which there are no moves for example so if you had marbles at the alternate positions lets say marbles in
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,6:54,7:37,the chess board pattern so suppose after moving some number of marbles around you reach this particular configuration here you can see that there is no further moves possible so if you call this as first position and this is position number in position number there are many moves for example you can consider these positions and make a move or you can consider these
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,7:37,8:05,and consider a move or you can consider these or you can consider these three so many moves are there and after the first move is made there are again many moves that are left so you could choose any of those things and keep on repeatedly doing suppose we reach the configuration then from there are the no further moves possible
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,8:05,8:24,and there are no undos so that will be a position in which you get stuck also if you have just marble there is no way you can move anything around so that is also a dead end so question is starting from can you reach a position a configuration with precisely
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,8:24,8:50,marble the answer to this question is yes there are you can do that but what we will consider in this lecture is a little it is a variant of this in the sense can we reach a configuration where there is only marble but that is at lets say this corner position
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,8:50,9:20,so the only marble remaining is appearing at one of the corners is this possible and to this question if we want to list out all the possible moves the first move itself there are possible moves and in between there could be a multiple number of moves so it could be a very large number of moves to explore if you wanted to conclude that
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,9:20,9:47,there are that it is impossible to reach a particular configuration you can model it as a search through the configuration space so each configuration can be described by a let us say a bit vector with positions each a bit vector of length tells whether a marble is present at a position or not
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,9:47,10:05,and from each bit vector you can move to certain other bit vectors you can move from one position to another if there is a valid move which will take you from one to other and then this can be reformulated as a search problem on a graph but the search space is
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,10:05,10:29,really huge here so we can not really hope to do a computerized check to figure out whether certain configurations are reachable or not and if the same configurations if it is imagined on a i mean if the same game if it is imagined on a larger board with more positions then it is hopelessly intractable
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,10:29,11:07,we will see that in some cases we can use some cleaver arguments to say that you cannot reach certain configurations so we will use some standard tools from computer science while we argue about these the moves are nondeterministic in the sense we have no control over the choices made by some player while he is playing
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,11:07,11:35,this particular game so in order to argue that none of the sequence is of moves can reach a certain configuration we need to answer about all possible moves the tools that we will use to solve this the main thing is a there is a key thing that is used in many proofs this is called as invariance
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,11:35,12:05,so here we have some particular so we think of this as an algorithm so somebody some adversary is performing some sequence of operations on some configuration space and each configuration has to follow certain rules it is either the horizontal case or the vertical case but we will identify some quantity associated with each configuration such that that quantity
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,12:05,12:31,remains invariant it does not change even after the moves is made and once we have established an invariant what we can argue is that no matter what are the moves done by the adversary the first configuration and the last configuration whatever are the sequence of steps that take you to the last final configuration the invariant
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,12:31,13:01,must be satisfied and if we can argue that the configuration that we want to end up with does not have the invariant property then we can say that look that is a configuration that is unreachable so let us identify what is invariant property here so in order to describe the invariance what we will need is the idea of groups
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,13:01,13:25,we will not initially formulate in terms of group theory but we will explain it via simpler methods so let us sowhat we are going to do is the following so look at these positions we are going to number these positions in a certain way and based on the numbers that
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,13:25,13:50,we give to these positions and the presence or absence of marbles on individual position based on that we will come up with a numerical quantity so there are positions of the board so what we will do is we will look at this board configuration and to each position in
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,13:50,14:16,the board we will give a certain colour so these colours let us call these colours as a b and c so this position gets colour a and the next one gets b and the next one gets c and we do this systematically so a b c so this is again going to be a
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,14:16,15:23,a b c a b c a a b c this is also going to be an a this is going to be a b and these positions are going to be the c positions so we looked at the board position and we gave colours or we labeled each of these positions
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,15:23,15:49,as a b and c now we are in position to determine the value of the board so the value of the board is determined by combining the colours given to the positions which have marbles in them so let us say the positions which do not have marble we can probably cross it out
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,15:49,16:18,so initially these positions did not have a marble and all the other positions contain marble so at any position the value of the board is obtained by combining the values of the positions i mean the value of the board is determined by combining the colours at the positions where there are marbles
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,16:18,16:37,so initially there are such positions they are combined and we get a value now how are these colors combined so we will follow the simple rule that whenever distinct colours combine you get the third colour so if a red and the green combine you will get a blue
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,16:37,16:55,if a blue and the red combine you will get a green and so on so distinct colours when they combine you get the third colour and if a colour combines with itself you will get a brand new colour so there is a fourth colour in the picture lets denote it by pink
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,16:55,17:49,so this is the fourth colour so let us just write our setup so we define what is a value of a board this is obtained by combining the colours at the occupied positions so we have defined the value of a board by combining the colours at the occupied positions
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,17:49,18:22,so given any board we know how to compute the value now this combination means the following if you think of c and c as a colour and if c not equal to c then they combine to produce c and if the colours are same if c is equal to c then they give rise to
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,18:22,18:51,c so c is a new colour now this combination rule when you think about it this applies only to colours red green and blue if it was a fourth colour if it was the pink colour then that colour combines with any colour it does not change anything so that is third rule
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,18:51,19:11,c does not change any colour in the sense if you combine a red and the pink what you will get is a red if you combine a green and a pink you will get a pink if you combine a blue and a pink then you will get a pink colour
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,19:11,19:33,and pink and pink when they combine will still get a pink colour so we have described the rules of combining colours there are colours on the board but when you determine the value we had introduced a fourth colour so colour combines and give rise to the colour which is not present if these colours
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,19:33,20:00,are red green and blue the fourth colour was used at any time that will not change the colour of anything that it combines with so now we have defined formally what is the value of a board now let us look at the initial value of the board so the way in which these colours combine does not really matter because all that mattes
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,20:00,20:26,is the when you have let us say so you can convince yourself that the order of combinations do not really matter that means whether red first combines with the blue and then combines with the green or the other way really does not matter because so let us say we write down these colours c so if you arrange them as alpha
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,20:26,20:45,alpha alpha k these are the colours now at any point alpha alpha same as if you combine alpha and alpha that is the same as combining alpha and alpha so any rearrangement of colours is still okay so any order of combining them will give rise to the same colour
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,20:45,21:07,so for this board what is the initial value of the board think about it for a few seconds so we can determine it by looking at the rose looking at this diagram carefully so if you look at the top most row the red and green combines to give a blue
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,21:07,21:35,blue and blue combines to give a pink so any of them because all these were occupied positions all these give rise to pink and the pinks when they combine with each other they do not do anything they would not bring in any change so you are going to get a pink by combining this
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,21:35,21:54,and the red and blue where occupied positions where as a green in the center was unoccupied so the total product is going to be just the product of or the total value of the board is going to be the value that you get when you combine a red with a blue and that is
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,21:54,22:34,going to be a pink and the others combine and give a pink pink and pink combines to give you a pink so the initial value is going to be pink now here is a crucial observation which is where we use a invariant property moves do not affect the value of the board
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,22:34,23:02,so look at the value of a board before and after a move is performed the value remains the same why is this so because let us look at any move think of it as horizontal and vertical is similar so you have positions so let us say we denote them by alpha alpha and alpha
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,23:02,23:28,two of them are going to be occupied lets say the occupied positions is what we call as alpha and alpha and alpha is the unoccupied position so this is the unoccupied position and this will change to unoccupied positions and occupied position the initial value of the board is going to be obtained by looking at all the other positions
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,23:28,23:53,so let us say this is the initial board or lets say before move configuration so let us say a denote the remaining of the board and then there are these positions alpha and alpha the occupied positions inside this they will combine and let us say it will give some value
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,23:53,24:18,a when alpha and alpha combine what you will get is clearly alpha so the initial value is a combined with alpha so i will write as a followed by alpha so this is the initial value and after the move these positions are unoccupied whereas the other positions remain unchanged
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,24:18,24:45,and alpha which was an initially unoccupied position now becomes an occupied position so the value after the move is going to be again a because those were the other positions the positions other than alpha and alpha and alpha their value if we denote it by a that followed by the only occupied position that is alpha
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,24:45,25:06,so if you combine these whatever value you get that is going be the value of the board so you look at any individual move that does not change the value of the board and we argued that at the start the value is b so after any move no matter what move you
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,25:06,25:38,perform what order you perform the value of the board should still remain b or green so if you call this as green position the value of the final board should be green so now if we asked whether we can obtain a board position with precisely marble at this position we can say that is not possible because that would be a board position whose
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,25:38,26:03,value is red but the only allowable board positions are the once in which the value is green so this was a neat little puzzle wherein we solved by identifying a crucial invariant property what has this got to do with group theory so here we talked about objects combining in a certain way it an another arbitrary
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,26:03,26:34,way of combining objects we found combining method very useful to solve our problem but many different objects i mean can be studied by this kind of methodologies wherein we identify some structures in the problem and use that to solve certain problems so what we have in any algebraic structure so let say what is an algebraic structure
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,26:34,27:28,so an algebraic structure is a set in our case this was colours and some operations on it and that was the way of combining so depending upon what are the properties that you insist of the operation you will get various algebraic structure so in our case we had we had a set of colours colours and we told how of them can combine
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,27:28,27:52,to give rise to a third colour so the particular thing that we used can also be called as a group so let us understand what are groups so formally we need to understand what are binary operations because these combining we are restricting to combining at a time you can combine more at a time you will get
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,27:52,28:14,more complex objects but we will restrict ourselves to binary operations so let us understand what are binary operations so you have a set let us call the set as g and a binary operation so we could use any symbol lets say plus multiplication subtraction all these are examples of binary
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,28:14,28:33,operation so that would be thought of as a function from g cross g to g that means take elements and map it to a third element of the set so it can be thought of as a function which takes a pair of objects from a set and gives
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,28:33,28:53,rise to an element of the set in the functional form this can be written as star followed by x y that means it is combining x and y and it is a function with parameters x and y but when we look at algebraic structures the most common notation for writing star
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,28:53,29:10,x y is x star y we will write it in between and not use the functional notation so the usual binary operations you can think of plus defined on either as a set of natural numbers or the set of integers or on the set of real numbers or complex numbers and
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,29:10,29:33,so on so that is a binary operation it takes elements combines them and gives a third element in the same set now if you think of the subtraction operation on the set of natural numbers that is not well defined so we should not really talk about subtraction on natural numbers because if you subtract
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,29:33,29:59,and if you look at minus the result is not really natural number so we want when we say binary operations by definition they take elements and return a third element so minus the answer is minus and that is not an element of n so minus cannot be viewed as a binary operation on this particular set but of course it can be viewed as a valid
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,29:59,30:37,binary operation on the set of integers so when in order to define what are groups we will need another property known as associativity so if you have let us say elements a b and c belonging to g we could first combine a and b and then combine it with c or we could have first combined b and c and a is combined
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,30:37,31:11,with the result of that if these are both equal then we say that the operation is associative so formally for every a b c belonging to g if a star b star c is equal to a star b star c use parenthesis to indicate which of the operations is done first
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,31:11,31:42,if this is equal then we say that star is associative so note that in our colour combination example the operation was indeed associative if you had first combined lets say if a b c were colours some of them may be equal or unequal each of them could be one of the colours
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,31:42,32:04,so if you can verify that a star b star c is equal to a star b star c so that was indeed a an associative operation infact it had an additional property whether you i mean we were just bothering about combining colours which one is written as a first colour and which one is written
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,32:04,32:25,as a second colour does not really matter so that is called as commutativity property so a star b is same as b star a so when we looked at the binary operation that was taking parameters and when you talk about parameters what is the first parameter and what is the
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,32:25,32:42,second parameter is important but if it is commutative then the order does not really matter a star b is equal to b star a by our definition of combining colours we did not really think of it in the functional way because this operation we wanted it to be commutative
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,32:42,33:17,so now after we have understood what is binary operations what is associativity and what is commutative we can define what is a group so the formal definition a group is a set g with an operation star we call it as star you can use any other symbol so it is a pair the first is a set and the second is an operation such that this is
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,33:17,33:54,properties first star is a binary operation so some books might say that this operation star is there is closure but that is when you say binary operation it is taken care of so this is the binary operation and you want this to be associative that means for any elements from g a b and c a star b star c no matter how you
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,33:54,34:30,parenthesis it you will get the same result and the third property is identity existence of identity that means there exist an element lets call that it as e such that for all a belonging to g a star e is equal to e star a and that is equal to a
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,34:30,34:48,so there is a special element we will later on prove that there can be only once such i mean if it is a group then there cannot be such elements so here when we say the definition we say that there is an element the property of identity says that there exists a special element such that any element of the group
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,34:48,35:20,when multiplied with that element will give rise to the same element it does not change things and the fourth property is that of inverse so formally this means for every element a belonging to g there exists an element b such that ab a multiplied by b or a star b is equal to b star a and that will be equal
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,35:20,35:43,to identity so if you can find a set equipped with a binary operation which has these properties that is it is associative it has an identity and every element has an inverse then we say that this is a group so let us look at our example we had colours
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,35:43,36:34,lets call these colours as by letters so this is our special colour which we which will do the role of e or the identity and let us call these as a b and c and you can check that for any elements so let us say x y z
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,36:34,37:00,so x star y star z is equal to x star y star z if x is identity so we have to verify for all cases if x is identity then what we have here is y star z that is because e combines with anything to leave it unchanged
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,37:00,37:14,so if x is e then this is going to be the left hand side is going to be y star z and the right hand side x combines with y is going to be y and the entire product is going to be or the entire expression on the right hand side is going to y star z
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,37:14,37:35,so when x is equal to e this is clear when any one of y and z if any of them is e then the same reasoning works out so we may assume that they are all different from e and if of them are the same so one case is when all of them are the same
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,37:35,37:55,for all of them are the same then does not really matter because left hand side and right hand side they all give rise to so let us say x star x star x x star x is going to give you e and x star e is going to be x and the other side is also going
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,37:55,38:16,be the same thing so when all them are the same does not matter if all of them are distinct then x y and z when they are all distinct y z will combine to give x and the entire product is going to e and the right hand side is similar
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,38:16,38:42,x star y is going to be z and z star z is going to e so when all of them are same all of them are different those cases are taken care of the only remaining case is when of them are the same so if y equals z and y star z will give you e and x star e is going to be x
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,38:42,39:00,if y is equal to z then the left hand side is going to x whereas the right hand side x into y will be the third missing element which we will call by w and w multiplied by z will give you the missing element here which is nothing but x
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,39:00,39:19,so in that case also things are going to be the same so here we assume that y and z are equal if x and y are same then the same reasoning applies and so on so we can verify in a systematic manner that the operation is associative and the pink
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,39:19,39:52,colour or e automatically serves as the identity and every element has an inverse namely the element itself is the inverse you take any element its inverse is itself because you multiply it with itself you will always get identity or you combine it with itself you get identity so in our example in solitaire problem we had basically assigned an element of group
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,39:52,40:32,to each position in the board and the value of the board was the product of the occupied positions so let us look at some properties of groups the first property that we will state is that the identity is unique every group will have a unique identity look at the definition we just said that there exist an element
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,40:32,41:00,there could be multiple how do we rule out that case so suppose e and e were both identities of a group and we want to show that e is equal e so we just need to look at e star e because e is the identity this has to be equal to
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,41:00,41:20,identity multiplied by any other element should leave that other element unchanged so this should be equal to e also because e is an identity we can say that e combined with e should leave e unchanged so this should be equal to e and therefore e is equal to e
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,41:20,41:52,so there is a unique identity the next property is that the inverses are also unique so the inverse we will denote it we will have a notation so if you have an element x since it is inverse is unique there is a specific element we will once we have this particular fact proven we can denote it by x inverse that will be
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,41:52,42:29,the unique inverse of any element x how do we prove that suppose let us say a and b are both inverses so what do we know because of this we can say that xa is equal to identity ax is equal to identity xb is identity and bx is also equal to identity
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,42:29,42:58,from these somehow we need to argue that a and b are same so let us look at this equation xa is equal to identity now if we multiply with b on the left what we will get is b times xa or b star xa so when i write xa it means i am just swallowing up the star instead of writing star each
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,42:58,43:26,time i will just write the letter so when i write bxa it means b star x star a and associativity guarantees that the order really does not matter so bxa that should be equal to b times e and that is b but here bxa we can write it as b times x times a
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,43:26,43:52,since bx is identity this is equal to identity times a and that is equal to a so we get a is equal to b so every element x will have a unique inverse in particular you if you look at the element e the identity element its inverse has to be itself because it satisfies the property
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,43:52,44:28,that so e times e is equal to e therefore e is an inverse of e and since it is the there is only inverse e has to be its own unique inverse and another property of inverse is this if you look at x inverse that is some particular element its inverse is equal to x that is
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,44:28,45:02,straight forward because by definition of inverse x times x inverse is equal to x inverse times x is equal to identity now if you let x inverse play the role of x then this equation says that the inverse of x inverse is equal to x because if you denote this by let us say alpha if you denote x inverse by alpha alpha times
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,45:02,45:31,x is equal to x times alpha and that is equal to identity therefore the inverse of alpha must be x the third property of inverse is if you multiply elements a and b and take their inverse that is going to be equal to the product of the inverses but done in the inverted fashion
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,45:31,45:59,so this wont be equal to a inverse times b inverse unless the group is commutative but in any case it will be equal to b inverse times a inverse that is because if you look at the product b inverse a inverse times ab this will be equal to identity and this will also be equal to ab times b inverse a inverse
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,45:59,46:24,so this has been bracketed in a certain way but because of associativity properties we can just bracket in other ways and you can combine them and see that they will give identity so we just need to look at b inverse times a times b so the initial combination of a inverse and a will give you identity
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,46:24,46:44,b inverse times identity will give you b inverse that multiplied by b gives identity same thing applied on the other side will again give you identity so ab inverse is b inverse times a inverse so we will stop here and will continue our exploration of algebraic structures in the
240.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,46:44,47:06,coming class
241.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,0:20,0:37,you you music well continue our study of groups a well continue our study of groups a group is basically an algebraic group is basically an algebraic group is basically an algebraic structure so we denoted by g star so it structure so we denoted by g star so it
241.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,0:37,0:48,structure so we denoted by g star so it is two components the first is a set and is two components the first is a set and is two components the first is a set and the second object is a binary relation the second object is a binary relation

241.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,1:11,1:42,operation and this binary operation should have certain properties the first should have certain properties the first should have certain properties the first property was it should be associative and the second requirement is there and the second requirement is there should be an identity and the third property was that every
241.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,1:42,1:51,and the third property was that every element should have an inverse these element should have an inverse these element should have an inverse these three properties are met for a binary three properties are met for a binary three properties are met for a binary operation on g then we say that g
241.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,1:51,1:59,operation on g then we say that g operation on g then we say that g together with the binary operation is a together with the binary operation is a together with the binary operation is a group the examples that we have seen one group the examples that we have seen one
241.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,1:59,2:17,group the examples that we have seen one of the examples that we saw we can of the examples that we saw we can of the examples that we saw we can describe it by its multiplication table describe it by its multiplication table describe it by its multiplication table so then we specify the binary operation
241.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,2:17,2:23,so then we specify the binary operation so then we specify the binary operation we basically need to tell for each pair we basically need to tell for each pair we basically need to tell for each pair of elements of elements of elements what is the result of combining them so

246.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,31:39,31:50,because k x is a irreducible because k x is a irreducible polynomial okay reason is irreducibility because if it was anything other than because if it was anything other than one then a x and k x has a common factor one then a x and k x has a common factor
246.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,31:50,31:55,one then a x and k x has a common factor and that common factor is a common is a and that common factor is a common is a and that common factor is a common is a factor of k x so gcd ax and a xk x factor of k x so gcd ax and a xk x
246.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,31:55,32:05,factor of k x so gcd ax and a xk x equals and the definition of gcd is equals and the definition of gcd is equals and the definition of gcd is the smallest positive linear combination the smallest positive linear combination the smallest positive linear combination okay so what this also means is we can
246.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,32:05,32:18,okay so what this also means is we can okay so what this also means is we can find alpha x and beta x as that alpha x find alpha x and beta x as that alpha x find alpha x and beta x as that alpha x ax plus beta x k x is equal to ok now
246.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,32:18,32:28,ax plus beta x k x is equal to ok now ax plus beta x k x is equal to ok now this would mean that alpha x into ax is this would mean that alpha x into ax is this would mean that alpha x into ax is equal to minus beta x times k x ok so
246.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,32:28,32:35,equal to minus beta x times k x ok so equal to minus beta x times k x ok so if you look at this particular if you look at this particular if you look at this particular polynomial lets call that as g x okay polynomial lets call that as g x okay
246.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,32:35,32:44,polynomial lets call that as g x okay what we know is alpha x when x ax gives what we know is alpha x when x ax gives what we know is alpha x when x ax gives g x and if we look at this mod k x this
246.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,32:44,32:58,g x and if we look at this mod k x this g x and if we look at this mod k x this gx is nothing but so alpha x into ax gx is nothing but so alpha x into ax gx is nothing but so alpha x into ax is mod k x so that means if we look at
246.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,32:58,33:10,is mod k x so that means if we look at is mod k x so that means if we look at the polynomial corresponding to alpha x the polynomial corresponding to alpha x the polynomial corresponding to alpha x means consider the remainder obtained on means consider the remainder obtained on
246.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,33:10,33:35,means consider the remainder obtained on dividing alpha x by k x lets call that dividing alpha x by k x lets call that dividing alpha x by k x lets call that as alpha prime x alpha prime x is the multiplicative inverse of x so if we multiplicative inverse of x so if we took an arbitrary polynomial from our
246.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,33:35,33:40,took an arbitrary polynomial from our took an arbitrary polynomial from our collection and since this cd with k x is collection and since this cd with k x is collection and since this cd with k x is we can find a linear combination of x we can find a linear combination of x
246.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,33:40,33:46,we can find a linear combination of x and k x which gives us and from that and k x which gives us and from that and k x which gives us and from that we can extract an inverse of x ok that we can extract an inverse of x ok that
246.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,33:46,33:54,we can extract an inverse of x ok that means that every element is invertible means that every element is invertible means that every element is invertible and therefore this collection forms a and therefore this collection forms a and therefore this collection forms a group ok what needs to be further shown
246.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,33:54,34:02,group ok what needs to be further shown group ok what needs to be further shown is that for every degree is that for every degree is that for every degree there is an irreducible polynomial its there is an irreducible polynomial its there is an irreducible polynomial its little beyond the scope of this course
246.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,34:02,34:11,little beyond the scope of this course little beyond the scope of this course so you just assumed that that for any so you just assumed that that for any so you just assumed that that for any particular degree there is an particular degree there is an particular degree there is an irreducible polynomial of that degree so
246.json,"Discrete Mathematics by Prof. Benny George K, Prof. Sajith Gopalan (Lec 27-43)",NPTEL,34:11,34:36,irreducible polynomial of that degree so irreducible polynomial of that degree so thats the end of this lecture thats the end of this lecture thats the end of this lecture music
