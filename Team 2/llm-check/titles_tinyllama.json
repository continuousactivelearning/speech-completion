The matrix is a square matrix with rows and columns corresponding to vertices and edges. Each entry in the matrix represents a connection between two vertices, with 1 indicating a direct connection (either upwards or downwards) and 0 indicating an indirect connection (either through another vertex).  In either representation, each vertex has a list telling every other vertex what edges it shares, including those shared by itself.

This holds since the first partition has length 1 or less, and so on for every successive partition until we reach the last partition.  2. Consider all possible partitions and partition them into disjoint subsets, forming an n-set of subsets with size n minus the length of the longest chain. We can do this inductively by considering subdiagrams in the first partition.  3. Finally, for each subset of partitions, consider its length, which is at most one if it's not a disjoint subset and equal to 1 if it is a disjoint subset. This gives us our chain lengths as n+1.
