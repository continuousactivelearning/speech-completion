This project implements a system to **estimate semantic completion percentage** of lecture-style input text using two intelligent backends:
- A **supervised BiGRU model** trained on GloVe embeddings
- A **Generative LLM (Gemma 2B)** fine-tuned on structured instructional data

It includes:
- ⚙️ A Flask-based Python backend
- 💻 A ReactJS-based frontend
- 📊 Real-time convergence tracking using keyword and entity metrics

This comprises two repositories
- backend
- frontend
  
The instructions to execute these are present within the README files in the respective folders
