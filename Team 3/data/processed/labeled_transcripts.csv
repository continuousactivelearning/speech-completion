1,Muniba_Mazari,1_1,"Well, I always start my talk with a disclaimer. And that disclaimer is that I've never claimed to be a motivational speaker. Yes, I do speak, but I feel more like a storyteller, because wherever I go, I share a story with everyone. Well, it is the story of a woman whose perfectly imperfect life made her who and what she is today. It's the story of a woman who, in pursuit of her dreams and aspirations, made other people realize that if you think that your life is hard and you're giving up on that because you think your life is unfair, think again.",1.89,0-5
1,Muniba_Mazari,1_2,"Because when you think that way, you are being unfair to your own self. I believe in the power of words. Many people speak before they think that I know the value of words. The words can make you break you. They can heal your soul.",3.77,0-5
1,Muniba_Mazari,1_3,They can damage you forever. So I always try to use the positive words in my life wherever I go. They call it adversity. I call it opportunity. They call it weakness.,5.66,5-10
1,Muniba_Mazari,1_4,I call it strength. They call me disabled. I call myself differently abled. They see my disability. They see my disability.,7.55,5-10
1,Muniba_Mazari,1_5,"I see my ability. There are some incidents that happen in your life, and those incidents are so strong that they change your DNA. Those incidents, or accidents are so strong that they break you physically. They deform your body, but they transform your soul. I was 18 years old when I got married.",9.43,5-10
1,Muniba_Mazari,1_6,"I belonged to a very conservative family, a beloche family, where good daughters never say no to their parents. My father wanted me to get married, and all I said was, if that makes you happy, I will say yes. And of course, it was never a happy marriage. Just about after two years of getting married, about nine years ago, I had a car accident. Somehow my husband fell asleep.",11.32,10-15
1,Muniba_Mazari,1_7,"And the car fell in the ditch. He managed to jump out, saved himself. I'm happy for him. But I stayed inside the car and I sustained a lot of injuries. List is a bit long.",13.21,10-15
1,Muniba_Mazari,1_8,"Don't get scared. I'm perfectly fine now. Radius ulna of my right arm were fractured. The wrist was fractured. Shoulder, bone and collarbone were fractured.",15.09,15-20
1,Muniba_Mazari,1_9,"My whole ribcage got fractured. And because of the ribcage injury, lungs and liver were badly injured. I couldn't breathe. I lost urinal bowel control. That's why I have to wear the bag wherever I go.",16.98,15-20
1,Muniba_Mazari,1_10,"But that injury that changed me and my life completely as a person and my perception towards living my life was the spine injury. Three wordtebra off. My backbone were completely crushed and I got paralyzed for the rest of my life. So this accident took place in a far flung area in the outskirts of a very small province, Balochistan, where there was no first aid, no hospital, no ambulance. I was in the middle of nowhere in that toppled car.",18.87,15-20
1,Muniba_Mazari,1_11,"Many people came to rescue. They gave me CPR. They dragged me out of the car. And while they were dragging me out, I got the complete transaction of my spondyl cord. And now there was this debate going on should we keep it here?",20.75,20-25
1,Muniba_Mazari,1_12,"She's going to die. Where should we go? There is no ambulance. There was this four wheeler jeep standing in the corner of the street. They said, put her in the back of the jeep and take her to the hospital, which is 3 hours away from this place.",22.64,20-25
1,Muniba_Mazari,1_13,And I still remember that bumpy ride. I was all broken. They threw me at the back of the jeep and they rushed me to the hospital. That is where I realized that my half body was fractured and half was paralyzed. I finally ended up in a hospital where I stayed for two and a half months.,24.53,20-25
1,Muniba_Mazari,1_14,I underwent multiple surgeries. Doctors have put a lot of titanium in my arm. There's a lot of titanium at my back to fix my back. That's why people in Pakistan call me the Iron Lady of Pakistan. There are always turning points in your life.,26.42,25-30
1,Muniba_Mazari,1_15,"There was a rebirth day that I celebrated after two years and two and a half months when I was able to sit on a wheelchair. That was the day when I had the rebirth. I was a completely different person. I still remember the day I sat on the wheelchair for the first time, knowing that I'm never going to leave this, knowing that I won't be able to walk for the rest of my life. I saw myself in the mirror and I talked to myself and I still remember what I said.",28.3,25-30
1,Muniba_Mazari,1_16,"I cannot wait for a miracle to come and make me walk. I cannot sit in the corner of the room crying, cribbing and begging for mercy because nobody has time. So I have to accept myself the way I am, the sooner the better. So I applied the lip color for the first time and I erased it and I cried",30.19,30-35
1,Muniba_Mazari,1_17,"and I said, what am I doing? A person on a wheelchair should not do this. What will people say? Clean it up. I put it again.",32.08,30-35
1,Muniba_Mazari,1_18,This time I put it for myself. Because I wanted to feel perfect from within. And that day I decided that I'm going to live life for myself. I am not going to be that perfect person for someone. I am just going to take this moment,33.96,30-35
1,Muniba_Mazari,1_19,and I will make it perfect for myself. And you know how it all began? That day? I decided that I'm going to fight my fears. We all have fears.,35.85,35-40
1,Muniba_Mazari,1_20,"Fear of unknown, fear of known, fear of losing people, fear of losing health, money. We want to excel in career, we want to become famous. We want to get money. We are scared all the time. So I wrote down, one by one, all those fears and I decided that I'm going to overcome these fears one at a time.",37.74,35-40
1,Muniba_Mazari,1_21,Do you know what was my biggest fear? Divorce. I couldn't stand this word. I was trying to cling onto this person who didn't want me anymore. But I said no.,39.62,35-40
1,Muniba_Mazari,1_22,"I have to make it work. But the day I decided that this is nothing but my fear. I liberated myself by setting him free. And I made myself emotionally so strong that the day I got the news that he is getting married, I sent him a text that I'm so happy for you and I wish you all the best. And he knows that I pray for him today.",41.51,40-45
1,Muniba_Mazari,1_23,"You will be surprised to know another bigger fear that I had in me. It was facing people. I used to hide myself from people when I was on bed for two years. I used to keep the door closed. I used to pretend that I'm not going to meet anyone, tell them that I'm sleeping.",43.4,40-45
1,Muniba_Mazari,1_24,"You know why? Because I couldn't stand that sympathy that they had for me. They used to treat me like a patient when I used to smile. They used to look at me and say that, ""You're smiling. Are you okay?""",45.28,45-50
1,Muniba_Mazari,1_25,"I was tired of this question being asked, ""Are you sick?"" Well, a lady yesterday at the airport asked me, ""Are you sick?"" And I said, well, besides the spinal cord injury, I'm fine, I guess. But those are really cute questions. They never used to feel cute when I was on the bed.",47.17,45-50
1,Muniba_Mazari,1_26,"So I used to hide myself from people knowing that, oh, my God, I'm not going to see that sympathy in their eyes, it's all right. And today I'm here speaking to all these amazing people, because I have overcome the fear. Last but not least, the woman who made me realize that heroes have no gender. The woman who believed in me even when I was completely at the words of despair where everybody left, she was there. And every time I looked at her without saying anything, she used to look at me and said, this too shall pass.",49.06,45-50
1,Muniba_Mazari,1_27,"God has a bigger plan. And one day you will say that, oh, my God. That is why God has chosen me. She never cried in front of me. She has always said that there will be haters, there will be naysayers, there will be disbelievers, and then there will be you proving them wrong.",50.94,50-55
1,Muniba_Mazari,1_28,"My mother… whatever I am today, I'm nothing without her. I'm nothing without her. Thank you, Mama. I wish you were here. Thank you for making me who I am today.",52.83,50-55
1,Muniba_Mazari,1_29,We have this thing in mind. We call it perfection. We want everything perfect. We want ourselves to be perfect. There is this image in our head about everything.,54.72,50-55
1,Muniba_Mazari,1_30,"Perfect life, perfect relationships, perfect career, perfect amount of money that we need to earn no matter what. Nothing is perfect in this world. We all are perfectly imperfect. And that is perfectly all right. That's all right.",56.6,55-60
1,Muniba_Mazari,1_31,"We were sent here not to become the perfect people. Those people who tell you how to look perfect, even those people are imperfect. Trying to fight this fear of looking imperfect. I used to be perfect. I still remember.",58.49,55-60
1,Muniba_Mazari,1_32,"I got this compliment years ago when I used to walk. Oh, my God, look at you. You are fair. You are tall. You're perfect.",60.38,60-65
1,Muniba_Mazari,1_33,Look at me now. Audience: You're still perfect. Muniba Mazari: Only the perfect eyes can see that. Only the perfect eyes will see that.,62.26,60-65
1,Muniba_Mazari,1_34,"Only the perfect eyes will see that. So, yes, in all those imperfections, you have to listen to your heart. You don't have to look good for people. You don't have to be perfect just because other people want you to be perfect. If your soul is perfect from within, that's all right.",64.15,60-65
1,Muniba_Mazari,1_35,"This is all what you want. This is all what you need to be. Our society has made very weird, very weird kind of norms to look perfect and great. For men, it's different. For women, it's different.",66.04,65-70
1,Muniba_Mazari,1_36,We think too much about what people say. We listen to ourselves too little. You know what makes you perfect? When you make someone smile. You know what makes you perfect?,67.92,65-70
1,Muniba_Mazari,1_37,When you try to do something good for the people around you. You know what makes you perfect? When you feel someone's pain. And how beautiful pain is that it connects you with people. No other medium can connect you with others but pain.,69.81,65-70
1,Muniba_Mazari,1_38,"That's why I always say that I'm in pain. And that's a blessing in disguise for me. Every time I go in public, I always smile. It's always a big do. They smile on my face.",71.7,70-75
1,Muniba_Mazari,1_39,"And people ask me, don't you get tired of smiling all the time? What's the secret? I always say one thing that I have stopped worrying about the things that I have lost, the people that I've lost, things and people who are meant to be with me are with me. And sometimes somebody's absence make you a better person. Cherish their absence.",73.58,70-75
1,Muniba_Mazari,1_40,"It's always It's always a blessing in disguise. I always say that people are so lucky, they don't even realize. You must be thinking, okay, you're lucky. In what sense?",75.47,75-80
1,Muniba_Mazari,1_41,"Well, the breath that you just took was a blessing. Embrace it. There are so many people in the world who are dreaming to live a life that you are living right now. You have no idea. Embrace each and every breath that you are taking.",77.36,75-80
1,Muniba_Mazari,1_42,"Celebrate your life. Live it. Don't die before your death. We all die. We live this one routine of a day for 75 years, and we call it life.",79.25,75-80
1,Muniba_Mazari,1_43,"No, that's not life. If you are still thinking why you have been sent here, if you're still juggling with the concept of why you are here, you haven't lived yet. You work hard, you make money, you do it for yourself. That's not life. You go out, you seek for people who need your help.",81.13,80-85
1,Muniba_Mazari,1_44,"You make their lives better. You become that sponge which can absorb all the negativity. And you become that person who can emit beautiful, positive vibes. And when you realize that you have changed someone's life and because of you, this person didn't give up. That is the day when you live.",83.02,80-85
1,Muniba_Mazari,1_45,"Always. We were talking about gratitude. Why I smile all the time. I cry all night when nobody sees me, because I'm a human and I have to keep the balance. And I smile all day because I know that if I will smile, I can make people smile.",84.91,80-85
1,Muniba_Mazari,1_46,"That keeps me going. Be grateful for what you have, and you will always, always end up having more. But if you'll cry and if you'll crypt for the. Little things that you don't have or the things that you have lost, you will never, ever have enough. Sometimes we are too busy thinking about the things that we don't have, that we forget to cherish the blessings that we have.",86.79,85-90
1,Muniba_Mazari,1_47,"I'm not saying that I'm not healthy and that makes me unlucky. But yes, it is hard. It is hard when I say that I cannot walk. It is hard to say when I wear this bag. It hurts.",88.68,85-90
1,Muniba_Mazari,1_48,But I have to keep going. Because never giving up is the way to live. Always. So I'll end my talk on a very short note. Live your life fully.,90.57,90-95

1,Muniba_Mazari,1_50,"Love yourself and spread that love. Life will be hard. There will be turmoils, there will be trials. But that will only make you stronger. Never give up.",94.34,90-95
1,Muniba_Mazari,1_51,The real happiness doesn't lie in money or success or fame. I have this all I never wanted this. Real happiness lies in gratitude. So be grateful. Be alive and live every moment.,96.23,95-100

2,RIHANNA,2_0,"So I made it to Harvard. Never thought I'd be able to say that in my life, but it feels good. Thank you, Dr. Counter, thank you to the Harvard Foundation, and thank you, Harvard University for this great honor. Thank you. I'm incredibly humbled by this, to be acknowledged at this magnitude for something that in truth I've never wanted credit for.",0.0,0-5
2,RIHANNA,2_1,"When I was five or six years old, I remember watching TV and I would see these commercials and I was watching other children suffer in other parts of the world and you know the commercials were [like], 'you can give 25 cents, save a child's life,' you know? And I would think to myself like, I wonder how many 25 cents I could save up to save all the kids in Africa. And I would say to myself you know, 'when I grow up, when I can get rich, I'mma save kids all over the world.' I just didn't know I would be in the position to do that by the time I was a teenager.",8.33,5-10
2,RIHANNA,2_2,"At 17 I started my career here in America, and by the age of 18, I started my first charity organization. I went on to team up with other organizations in the following years and met, helped, and even lost some of the most beautiful souls, from six-year-old Jasmina Anema who passed away in 2010 from leukemia, her story inspired thousands to volunteer as donors through DKMS. Fast forward to 2012 and then my grandmother, the late Clara Brathwaite, she lost her battle with cancer, which is the very reason and the driving force behind the Clara Lionel Foundation. We're all human. And we all just want a chance: a chance at life, a chance in education, a chance at a future, really.",16.67,15-20
2,RIHANNA,2_3,"And at CLF, our mission is to impact as many lives as possible, but it starts with just one. Just one. As I stare out into this beautiful room, I see optimism, I see hope, I see the future. I know that each and every one of you has the opportunity to help someone else. All you need to do is help one person, expecting nothing in return.",25.0,25-30
2,RIHANNA,2_4,"To me, that is a humanitarian. People make it seem way too hard, man. The truth is, and what I want the little girl watching those commercials to know, is you don't have to be rich to be a humanitarian. You don't have to be rich to help somebody. You don't gotta be famous.",33.33,30-35
2,RIHANNA,2_5,"You don't even have to be college-educated. I mean, I wish I was, I'm not saying you know… [Crowd laughs] Especially today. [laughs] It's true, I might come back but all right. [Crowd cheers]",41.67,40-45
2,RIHANNA,2_6,"But it starts with your neighbor, the person right next to you, the person sitting next to you in class, the kid down the block in your neighborhood, you just do whatever you can to help in any way that you can. And today I want to challenge each of you to make a commitment to help one person: one organization, one situation that touches your heart. My grandmother always used to say if you've got a dollar, there's plenty to share. Thank you ladies and gentlemen. It was my honor.",50.0,50-55
2,RIHANNA,2_7,"HARVARD STUDENT: Over her career, she has worked on several projects aimed towards bettering society. Including efforts to increase access to education globally through her Clara Lionel Foundation global scholarship program and her support for the global partnership for education and global citizen. But for this part of the night, I like to highlight some of the work she's done in the field of health and in helping to empower others in that way. Part of Rihanna's humanitarian work has been to develop a cancer diagnosis and treatment center at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Bridgetown Barbados. As a student of global health, the impact of such an institution is not lost on me.",58.33,55-60
2,RIHANNA,2_8,"Too often higher levels of medical care are inaccessible to the populations that need them. Allowing individuals to unnecessarily suffer from preventable or treatable conditions. In my experience studying global health issues abroad, in western Kenya for example, one of the greatest barriers to obtaining medical care was distance. Distance to the treatment centers that offered the needed care. During my time there I remember learning the story of a woman who had lost her life during labor.",66.67,65-70
2,RIHANNA,2_9,"She was being taken care of at a rural health clinic where typical labor procedures could be handled effectively, however, because of her specific complications the type of care she needed was at a larger health center which she couldn't reach in time. Fortunately, there are efforts locally and globally to tackle issues such as these and I tell this story not to single out a specific region but to highlight them for the importance of this work. In providing such valuable resources for cancer treatment in Barbados, Rihanna has worked to reduce barriers such as these to higher level medical care and the implementation of such work has reverberations throughout society. I find this quotation from Rihanna particularly telling of the humanitarian spirit displayed by such work: ""If you have the ability to help and lend a hand, no matter how big or small, you should definitely make that your responsibility"". To me, the idea that ability to help others, no matter how big or small, now becomes a responsibility is one that embodies what it means to be a humanitarian.",75.0,75-80
2,RIHANNA,2_10,"To prioritize helping fellow human beings to the extent that one can is to exemplify humanitarianism. As many of us are students and we'll be navigating life outside of this university in a few years I hope this humanitarian spirit is one that we will incorporate wherever life may take us. Thank you, Rihanna, for inspiring us to use our abilities to work, work, work and to exercise these abilities in the service of authors. Thank you. Rihanna, we thank you for your compassion.",83.33,80-85

3,Mr_Bean,3_0,"""My starting point when it comes to the consideration of any issue relating to free speech is my passionate belief that the second most precious thing in life is the right to express yourself freely. The most precious thing in life I think is food in your mouth and the third most precious is a roof over your head but a fixture in the Number 2 slot for me is free expression, just below the need to sustain life itself. That is because I have enjoyed free expression in this country all my professional life and expect to continue to do so, I personally highly unlikely to be arrested for whatever laws exist to contain free expression, because of the undoubtedly privileged position that is afforded to those of a high public profile. So, my concerns are less for myself and more for those more vulnerable because of their lower profile. Like the man arrested in Oxford for calling a police horse, gay.",0.0,0-5
3,Mr_Bean,3_1,"Or the teenager arrested for calling the Church of Scientology a cult. Or the café owner arrested for displaying passages from the bible on a TV screen. When I heard of some of these more ludicrous offences and charges, I remembered that I had been here before in a fictional context. I once did a show called Not the Nine O'Clock News, some years ago, and we did a sketch where Griff Rhys-Jones played Constable Savage, a manifestly racist police officer to whom I, as his station commander, is giving a dressing down for arresting a black man on a whole string of ridiculous, trumped up and ludicrous charges. The charges for which Constable Savage arrested Mr. Winston Kodogo of 55 Mercer Road were these: 'Walking on the cracks in the pavement.'",9.09,5-10
3,Mr_Bean,3_2,"'Walking in a loud shirt in a built-up area during the hours of darkness' and one of my favourites 'Walking around all over the place.' He was also arrested for 'Urinating in a public convenience' and 'Looking at me in a funny way'. Who would have thought that we would end up with a law that would allow life to imitate art so exactly. I read somewhere, a defender of the status quo claiming that the fact that the gay horse case was dropped after the arrested man refused to pay the fine and that the Scientology case was also dropped at some point during the court process was proof that the law working well, ignoring the fact that the only reason these cases were dropped was because of the publicity that they had attracted. The Police sensed that ridicule was just around the corner and withdrew their actions.",18.18,15-20
3,Mr_Bean,3_3,"But what about the thousands of other cases that did not enjoy the oxygen of publicity? That weren't quite ludicrous enough to attract media attention? Even for those actions that were withdrawn, people were arrested, questioned, taken to court and then released. That isn't a law working properly: that is censoriousness of the most intimidating kind, guaranteed to have, as Lord Dear says, a 'chilling effect' on free expression and free protest. Parliament's Joint committee on Human Rights summarized, as you may know, this whole issue very well by saying 'While arresting a protestor for using threatening or abusive speech may, depending on the circumstances, be a proportionate response, we do not think that language or behaviour that is merely insulting should ever be criminalized in this way.'",27.27,25-30
3,Mr_Bean,3_4,"The clear problem with the outlawing of insult is that too many things can be interpreted as such. Criticism is easily construed as insult by certain parties. Ridicule is easily construed as insult. Sarcasm, unfavourable comparison, merely stating an alternative point of view to the orthodoxy can be interpreted as insult. And because so many things can be interpreted as insult, it is hardly surprising that so many things have been, as the examples I talked about earlier show.",36.36,35-40
3,Mr_Bean,3_5,"Although the law under discussion has been on the statute book for over 25 years, it is indicative of a culture that has taken hold of the programmes of successive governments that, with the reasonable and well-intended ambition to contain obnoxious elements in society, has created a society of an extraordinarily authoritarian and controlling nature. It is what you might call The New Intolerance, a new but intense desire to gag uncomfortable voices of dissent. 'I am not intolerant', say many people; say many softly spoken, highly educated, liberal-minded people: 'I am only intolerant of intolerance'. And people tend to nod sagely and say 'Oh, wise words, wise words' and yet if you think about this supposedly inarguable statement for longer than five seconds, you realize that all it is advocating is the replacement of one kind of intolerance with another. Which to me doesn't represent any kind of progress at all.",45.45,45-50
3,Mr_Bean,3_6,"Underlying prejudices, injustices or resentments are not addressed by arresting people: they are addressed by the issues being aired, argued and dealt with preferably outside the legal process. For me, the best way to increase society's resistance to insulting or offensive speech is to allow a lot more of it. As with childhood diseases, you can better resist those germs to which you have been exposed. We need to build our immunity to taking offence, so that we can deal with the issues that perfectly justified criticism can raise. Our priority should be to deal with the message, not the messenger.",54.55,50-55
3,Mr_Bean,3_7,"As President Obama said in an address to the United Nations only a month or so ago: 'Llaudable efforts to restrict speech can become a tool to silence critics or oppress minorities. The strongest weapon against hateful speech is not repression, it is more speech.' And that is the essence of my thesis, more speech. If we want a robust society, we need more robust dialogue and that must include the right to insult or to offend. And as, even if, as Lord Dear says, you know, the freedom to be inoffensive is no freedom at all.",63.64,60-65
3,Mr_Bean,3_8,"The repeal of this word in this clause will be only a small step, but it will, I hope, be a critical one in what should be a longer-term project to pause and slowly rewind a creeping culture of censoriousness. It is a small skirmish in the battle, in my opinion, to deal with what Sir Salman Rushdie refers to as the 'outrage industry' – self-appointed arbiters of the public good, encouraging media-stoked outrage, to which the police feel under terrible pressure to react. A newspaper rings up Scotland Yard: 'Someone has said something slightly insulting on Twitter about someone who we think a national treasure. What are you going to do about it?' And the police panic and they scrabble around and then grasp the most inappropriate lifeline of all, Section 5 of the Public Order Act, that thing where they can arrest anybody for saying anything that might be construed by anyone else as insulting.",72.73,70-75
3,Mr_Bean,3_9,"You know, they don't seem to need a real victim, they need only to make the judgment that somebody could have been offended if they had heard or read what has been said. The most ludicrous degree of latitude. The storms that surround Twitter and Facebook comment have raised some fascinating issues about free speech, which we haven't really yet come to terms with. Firstly, that we all have to take responsibility for what we say, which is quite a good lesson to learn. But secondly, we've learnt how appallingly prickly and intolerant society has become of even the mildest adverse comment.",81.82,80-85
3,Mr_Bean,3_10,The law should not be aiding and abetting this new intolerance. Free speech can only suffer if the law prevents us from dealing with its consequences. I offer you my wholehearted support to the Reform Section 5 campaign. Thank very you.,90.91,90-95

The Reliance Foundation directly impacts the lives of more than 2.2 million women in India through its initiatives in education, health, rural transformation, disaster response and sports. Why do we do this?",7.69,5-10
4,Nita_Ambani,4_3,"Is it philanthropy? Is it CSR? Of course, it's all of these, but much more. The reason I do this is because I owe a debt. A debt I will go far and deep to repay.",11.54,10-15
4,Nita_Ambani,4_4,"All I'm doing is focusing on how soon and how well I can repay this debt. Allow me to explain what I mean. I was born in a family of 11 girls and one boy, a joint family. We were proud to grow up in a house that was free of gender bias. We were fortunate to be groomed as self-reliant, educated, free-willed and disciplined children.",15.38,15-20
4,Nita_Ambani,4_5,"I was interested in dance, so I pursued it and trained in Bharatanatyam. After my graduation, I wanted to teach, so I joined the school and started working as a teacher. When I was getting married, the only precondition I had was that I would continue working even after marriage. In my story, I had access to education, healthcare and the opportunity to work. Most importantly, I could make my own choices for myself because of an environment, an outlook that encouraged and enabled me.",19.23,15-20
4,Nita_Ambani,4_6,"Unfortunately, millions of women don't have access to basic things like healthcare, water, sanitation and education. Then there are those who, despite having all these, have no access to employment. And above all, they don't have the power to make their own choices. In India, women are discriminated against even before they are born. Seven hundred thousand girls are killed in the womb and from there onwards, it's an uphill struggle for girls.",23.08,20-25
4,Nita_Ambani,4_7,"The opportunity funnel just keeps on getting narrower and narrower for them. Over one million children below the age of five are lost each year, of which three hundred thousand die on the first day of life itself. Worst, a majority of them are girls. As a mother myself, I find this very painful to accept. Girls are neglected when unwell and not given priority for medical treatment in the family as compared to boys, leading to high infant mortality rates.",26.92,25-30
4,Nita_Ambani,4_8,More than 50 percent of girls fail to enroll to schools. Large number of girls drop out of school at puberty. One of the main reasons being the lack of separate toilets for them. Nearly 45 percent of girls in India get married before the age of 18. Seventy percent of women are not part of the workforce.,30.77,30-35
4,Nita_Ambani,4_9,"All these numbers paint a grim picture. We could have been one of these statistics. This could have been you. It could have been me. Yes, my story could easily have been just like theirs.",34.62,30-35
4,Nita_Ambani,4_10,"But I got lucky. Let me explain how. First, I got lucky through a lottery called births. I was born into a family that gave equal opportunities to girls and boys. Then I won a lottery called education because my family believed in the power of education, especially for girls.",38.46,35-40
4,Nita_Ambani,4_11,"And then I met Mukesh. Mukesh encouraged and supported me to pursue my passion, be it education, dance or sports. Thus, I continued making my own decisions and my choices even after marriage. But my story could have been very different. My story could easily have been just like that of many other women in India.",42.31,40-45
4,Nita_Ambani,4_12,"And that is why I owe a debt. We all owe a debt to our sisters who are not as fortunate. We stand at a very important time in history, a time when a crucial difference can be made. In about a decade, India will have the largest number of women in any country in the world. What kind of an India and what kind of a world do we want for ourselves and our children?",46.15,45-50
4,Nita_Ambani,4_13,"A world where women lag behind is not only an unequal world, it's an unjust world. It's an unfair world. And we cannot accept a world like that. Can the world be different from what it looks like today? I believe it's quite possible.",50.0,50-55
4,Nita_Ambani,4_14,"India has a rich tradition of worshipping goddesses. We worship goddess Saraswati for knowledge, goddess Lakshmi for wealth, goddess Durga who destroys all evil. We also have a proud history of women leaders from all walks of life, from Jhansi Ki Rani to Indira Gandhi to Mother Teresa and many others. These women make us believe in a world with possibilities, a world where women have equal opportunities, a world that is better not just for women but for everyone. According to IMF, if the number of women who joined the workforce in India were to increase the level of men, India's GDP would grow by 27%.",53.85,50-55
4,Nita_Ambani,4_15,"It is clear, empowered Indian women means a stronger and a better India. My work in India's poorest villages with women have shown me that we can change the story of Indian women. Take Vajaben. Vajaben is from Netrang, one of the poorest villages in Gujarat. On our first visit to that village, we were struck by the extreme misery.",57.69,55-60
4,Nita_Ambani,4_16,"Farms lay barren, people and children were malnourished. Even a simple meal was beyond their means. Then I met Vajaben. Her father was bedridden and she was a single mother of three young children. For them, life was a real struggle.",61.54,60-65
4,Nita_Ambani,4_17,"Yet there was something different about her. In her eyes was a determination to fight her circumstances. Our foundation wanted to help and our philosophy is to enable people to help themselves. So we helped and assisted Vajaben to set up a nutrition garden. Within three months, the garden was producing more than 200 kilograms of vegetables a month.",65.38,65-70
4,Nita_Ambani,4_18,"She was now self-reliant, but she didn't stop there. Vajaben motivated other women from her village to set up similar gardens and help them also to earn an income out of it. In a male-dominated community, she rallied other women around her to transform her own village. Soon Vajaben was elected as the president of the Village Farmers Association. Today thanks to Vajaben, there are 44 nutrition gardens in Netrang.",69.23,65-70
4,Nita_Ambani,4_19,No child goes to bed hungry or is malnourished. Every child goes to an Anganwadi for their well-being and education. I would like to believe there is a Vajaben in every village in India. We need to find them and empower them. They will do the rest.,73.08,70-75
4,Nita_Ambani,4_20,"Another example that comes to my mind is Prakash Kaur from Jalandhar. She comes from the state which has the highest rates of female infanticide in India. Unwanted girls are thrown into garbage dumps, abandoned on railway tracks or river banks. Prakash started picking up these girls and gave them a home and became their mother. Today she runs a unique home where she is a mother to 70 abandoned girls.",76.92,75-80
4,Nita_Ambani,4_21,"Prakash gave these little girls a new life where their own parents wished them death. When I met her at unique home, what really touched my heart was a compassion when she told me, I have not adopted these girls. They are my real daughters. Some of these girls are well-educated teenagers today and one of them is even studying to be a doctor. True to her name, Prakash is spreading light and hope.",80.77,80-85
4,Nita_Ambani,4_22,"These stories tell us that women can make a huge difference. However, we need millions of such stories. To achieve this, we need the right mindset and the right tool set as a society and as a community. When I see people in this room and the commitment to women's empowerment, I know the future looks bright. When I look at Prakash Kaur and Vajaben and hundreds of courageous women like them, I know there is hope.",84.62,80-85
4,Nita_Ambani,4_23,"Ultimately, supporting women is all about repaying the debt I owe to my sisters. It's all about ensuring that Vajaben and Prakash Kaur are not exceptions, but they become the norm. Supporting women is neither CSR or philanthropy. It is our moral responsibility. To support an idea, an idea of a better world.",88.46,85-90
4,Nita_Ambani,4_24,A world with equal opportunities. A world where women inspire the whole of humanity. A world where women can make their own choices and a world where India is at the forefront of that change. Let us together achieve the dream of that beautiful world. It's time for action.,92.31,90-95

I pledge to be a president who seeks not to divide but unify, who doesn't see red states and blue states, only sees the United States, and work with all my heart, with the confidence of the whole people, to win the confidence of all of you. For that is what America, I believe, is about.",8.0,5-10

I mean it, especially in those moments and especially for those moments when this campaign was at its lowest ebb, the African American community stood up again for me.

Now this campaign is over, what is the will of people? What is our mandate? I believe it's this: American have called upon us to marshal the forces of decency, the forces of fairness, to marshal the forces of science and the forces of hope in the great battles of our time, the battle to control the virus, the battle to build prosperity, the battle to secure your family's healthcare, the battle to achieve racial justice and root out systemic racism in this country.",48.0,45-50

The refusal of Democrats and Republicans to cooperate with one another is not some mysterious force beyond our control, it's a decision, a choice we make.

That in America everyone should be given an opportunity to go as far as their dreams and God-given ability will take them. You see, I believe in the possibilities of this country. We're always looking ahead, ahead to an America that's freer and more just, ahead to an America that creates jobs with dignity and respect, ahead to an America that cures diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's, ahead to an America that never leaves anyone behind, ahead to an America that never gives up, never gives in.",76.0,75-80

6,Sara_Ali_Khan,6_1,"It's something that my father inculcated in me very early in life. He said that education is of prime importance. But more than that, I think to find your own place in any institution is the most important. So, whether it's the subjects that you do, the university that you apply to, or the essay that you write, the one piece of advice that I would impart is do it honestly and do it yourself because there's a reason that universities ask you to write essays. You know, I got rejected from Oxford University, which is in England, which was my dream.",4.17,0-5
6,Sara_Ali_Khan,6_2,"It was my dream school to go to Oxford and I didn't get in. And I thought that the world was going to end that day. I was, I didn't know what to do. I called my mother up hysterically crying, saying, mom, I've gotten rejected from Oxford. I don't know what to do.",8.33,5-10
6,Sara_Ali_Khan,6_3,"And then short enough, you know, the common apps came in and I got into Columbia.

6,Sara_Ali_Khan,6_4,"But I would definitely say that when you think about education, as important as it is, it's also very personal. So, be sure and be careful to be yourself because that's the most important thing, anywhere. So, when I finished the 10th grade, I was almost convinced that I wanted to do Medicine.

6,Sara_Ali_Khan,6_6,"And I realized that as somebody that's loved studying, as somebody that till date loves reading, In a university like Columbia, in a city like New York, you know, I did courses in every field. I did history. I did Political Science. I did Chemistry. I did Math.",25.0,25-30

6,Sara_Ali_Khan,6_10,"Haha. But you know, here is where I am, so you know. You know, I have to say that I got very lucky because even though I've worked with big and established actors, they've both been extremely giving and generous as have my directors. So, I never felt, of course, there was personal intimidation, you know, that I felt within myself. Like in a van or by myself at home, I used to be like, oh my God, you know, I'm working with these actors and these directors and, you know, it was a little nerve wrecking.",41.67,40-45

6,Sara_Ali_Khan,6_17,"Competition matters, not getting negative about competition matters. So, actually, if anything, I look at my college and my school as a training ground for what I chose to do, which a lot of people find very surprising because they were like, really, I mean, you went to an Ivy league college as opposed to dance class. So, it's not really the most stereotypical training that you need. But I don't think that that's what it's about. For me, I don't even look at it as a transformation.",70.83,70-75
6,Sara_Ali_Khan,6_18,"I look at it as just a journey, you know, because going to college helped me identify who I am. It helped me find who I am. And I think that, that is the four most important thing for an actor. Because if you don't know who you are, there is no way that you'll be able to play five different characters and convey that because you need to know who you are at least. So, I don't really look at it as a transformation or a change.",75.0,75-80

And I can't believe that I'm saying that a candidate for President of the United States has bragged about sexually assaulting women. And I have to tell you that I can't stop thinking about this.

Maybe we're afraid to be that vulnerable. Maybe we've grown accustomed to swallowing these emotions and staying quiet because we've seen that people often won't take our word over his.

We teach our kids the value of being a team player, which is what Hillary exemplified when she lost the 2008 election and actually agreed to work for her opponent as our Secretary of State — earning sky-high approval ratings serving her country once again.

And to make sure that we understand what he means, he said that at the hour of death we are going to be judged on what we have been to the poor, to the hungry, naked, the homeless, and he makes himself that hungry one, that naked one, that homeless one, not only hungry for bread, but hungry for love, not only naked for a piece of cloth, but naked of that human dignity, not only homeless for a room to live, but homeless for that being forgotten, been unloved, uncared, being nobody to nobody, having forgotten what is human love, what is human touch, what is to be loved by somebody, and he says: Whatever you did to the least of these my brethren, you did it to me.

Our poor people are great people, are very lovable people, they don't need our pity and sympathy, they need our understanding love. They need our respect; they need that we treat them with dignity.

He went home to God, for dead is nothing but going home to God.

Even if mother could forget, but today millions of unborn children are being killed. And we say nothing.

And here I ask you, in the name of these little ones, for it was that unborn child that recognized the presence of Jesus when Mary came to visit Elizabeth, her cousin. As we read in the gospel, the moment Mary came into the house, the little one in the womb of his mother, lift with joy, recognized the Prince of Peace.

We have an opportunity here in Norway, you are with God's blessing, you are well to do. But I am sure in the families and many of our homes, maybe we are not hungry for a piece of bread, but maybe there is somebody there in the family who is unwanted, unloved, uncared, forgotten, there isn't love.

What surprised me most, not that she gave the rice, but what surprised me most, that in her suffering, in her hunger, she knew that somebody else was hungry, and she had the courage to share, share the love. And this is what I mean, I want you to love the poor, and never turn your back to the poor, for in turning your back to the poor, you are turning it to Christ.

But in spite of all her efforts, it has become clear that there are pessimists at home and abroad who think that after three years of indecision that this country has become a prisoner to the old arguments of 2016 and that in this home of democracy we are incapable of honouring a basic democratic mandate. And so I am standing before you today to tell you, the British people, that those critics are wrong.",0.0,0-5

And we will do a new deal, a better deal that will maximise the opportunities of Brexit while allowing us to develop a new and exciting partnership with the rest of Europe based on free trade and mutual support. I have every confidence that in 99 days' time we will have cracked it. But you know what – we aren't going to wait 99 days because the British people have had enough of waiting.",11.11,10-15

My job is to make your streets safer – and we are going to begin with another 20,000 police on the streets and we start recruiting forthwith. My job is to make sure you don't have to wait 3 weeks to see your GP and we start work this week with 20 new hospital upgrades, and ensuring that money for the NHS really does get to the front line. My job is to protect you or your parents or grandparents from the fear of having to sell your home to pay for the costs of care and so I am announcing now – on the steps of Downing Street – that we will fix the crisis in social care once and for all with a clear plan we have prepared to give every older person the dignity and security they deserve.

And though I am today building a great team of men and women, I will take personal responsibility for the change I want to see. Never mind the backstop – the buck stops here. And I will tell you something else about my job. It is to be Prime Minister of the whole United Kingdom and that means uniting our country, answering at last the plea of the forgotten people and the left-behind towns by physically and literally renewing the ties that bind us together, so that with safer streets and better education and fantastic new road and rail infrastructure and full-fibre broadband we level up across Britain with higher wages, and a higher living wage, and higher productivity, we close the opportunity gap, giving millions of young people the chance to own their own homes, and giving business the confidence to invest across the UK.",33.33,30-35

Everyone knows the values that flag represents. It stands for freedom and free speech and habeas corpus and the rule of law and above all it stands for democracy. And that is why we will come out of the EU on October 31 because in the end Brexit was a fundamental decision by the British people, that they wanted their laws made by people that they can elect and they can remove from office and we must now respect that decision and create a new partnership with our European friends – as warm and as close and as affectionate as possible.

And next I say to our friends in Ireland, and in Brussels and around the EU: I am convinced that we can do a deal without checks at the Irish border, because we refuse under any circumstances to have such checks, and yet without that anti-democratic backstop and it is of course vital at the same time that we prepare for the remote possibility that Brussels refuses any further to negotiate and we are forced to come out with no deal not because we want that outcome, of course not, but because it is only common sense to prepare. And let me stress that there is a vital sense in which those preparations cannot be wasted and that is because under any circumstances we will need to get ready at some point in the near future to come out of the EU customs union and out of regulatory control fully determined at last to take advantage of Brexit because that is the course on which this country is now set with high hearts and growing confidence we will now accelerate the work of getting ready. And the ports will be ready and the banks will be ready and the factories will be ready and business will be ready and the hospitals will be ready and our amazing food and farming sector will be ready and waiting to continue selling ever more not just here but around the world.",55.56,55-60

And to all those who continue to prophesy disaster I say yes – there will be difficulties, though I believe that with energy and application they will be far less serious than some have claimed. But if there is one thing that has really sapped the confidence of business over the last three years it is not the decisions we have taken, it is our refusal to take decisions. And to all those who say we cannot be ready, I say do not underestimate this country. Do not underestimate our powers of organisation and our determination because we know the enormous strengths of this economy in life sciences, in tech, in academia, in music, the arts, culture, financial services.",66.67,65-70

Let's get going now on our own position navigation and timing satellite and earth observation systems – UK assets orbiting in space with all the long term strategic and commercial benefits for this country. Let's change the tax rules to provide extra incentives to invest in capital and research and let's promote the welfare of animals that has always been so close to the hearts of the British people and yes, let's start now on those free trade deals because it is free trade that has done more than anything else to lift billions out of poverty.",77.78,75-80

And that was in 1995. That's also when the Internet started to happen.",16.67,15-20
10,Elon_Musk,10_6,"And I thought well I could either pursue this technology, where success may not be one of the possible outcomes, which is always tricky, or participate in the Internet and be part of it. So, I decided to drop out. Fortunately, we're past graduation, so, I can't be accused of recommending that to you. And I did some Internet stuff, you know. I've done a few things here and there.",20.0,20-25
10,Elon_Musk,10_7,"One of which is PayPal. Maybe it's helpful to say, one of the things that was important then in the creation of PayPal was how it started. Because initially – the initial thought with PayPal was to create a conglomeration of financial services, so if you have one place where all of your financial services needs could be seamlessly integrated and works smoothly. And we had a little feature, which was through e-mail payments. Whenever we'd show the system off to someone, we'd show the hard part, which was the conglomeration of financial services, which is quite difficult to put together.",23.33,20-25
10,Elon_Musk,10_8,"Nobody was interested. Then we showed people e-mail payments, which was quite easy, and everybody was interested. So, I think it's important to take feedback from your environment. You want to be as closed-loop as possible. So, we focused on e-mail payments and tried to make that work.",26.67,25-30
10,Elon_Musk,10_9,"And that's what really got things to take off. But, if we hadn't responded to what people said, then we probably would not have been successful. So, it's important to look for things like that and focus on them when you seem them, and you correct your prior assumptions. Going from PayPal, I thought well, what are some of the other problems that are likely to most affect the future of humanity? It really wasn't from the perspective of, 'what's the best way to make money,' which is okay, but it was really 'what do I think is going to most affect the future of humanity.'",30.0,30-35
10,Elon_Musk,10_10,"So, the biggest terrestrial problem we've got is sustainable energy. But the production and consumption of energy in a sustainable manner. If we don't solve that in this century, we're in deep trouble. And the other one being the extension of life beyond earth to make life multi-planetary. So that's the basis for — the latter is the basis for SpaceX and the former is the basis for Tesla and SolarCity.",33.33,30-35
10,Elon_Musk,10_11,"When I started SpaceX, initially, I thought that well, there's no way one could start a rocket company. I wasn't that crazy. But then, I thought, well, what is a way to increase NASA's budget? That was actually my initial goal. I thought well if we could do a low-cost mission to Mars, something called Mars Oasis, which would land with seeds in dehydrated nutrient gel, then hydrate them upon landing.",36.67,35-40
10,Elon_Musk,10_12,And you'd have this great short of money shot of green plants on a red background. The public tends to respond to precedence and superlatives. And this would be the first life on Mars and the furthest life had ever traveled as far as we know. And I thought well that would get people really excited and increase NASA's budget. So obviously the financial outcome from such a mission would probably be zero.,40.0,40-45
10,Elon_Musk,10_13,"So, anything better than that was on the upside. So, I went to Russia three times to look at buying a refurbished ICBM… because that was the best deal. And I can tell you it was very weird going there in late 2001-2002 going to the Russian rocket forces and saying, 'I'd like to buy two of your biggest rockets, but you can keep the nuke.' That's a lot more. That was 10 years ago, I guess.",43.33,40-45
10,Elon_Musk,10_14,"They thought I was crazy, but I did have money. So, that was okay. After making several trips to Russia, I came to the conclusion that… that actually my initial impression was wrong about – because my initial thought was, well, that there is not enough will to explore and expand beyond earth and have a Mars base, that kind of thing. But I came to the conclusion that was wrong. In fact, there's plenty of will, particularly in the United States.",46.67,45-50
10,Elon_Musk,10_15,"Because United States is a nation of explorers, so people who came here from other parts of the world. I think the United States is really a distillation of the spirit of human exploration. But if people think it's impossible, then well it's going to completely break the federal budget, then they're not going to do it. So, after my third trip, I said, okay, what we really need to do here is try to solve the space transport problem and started SpaceX. And this was against the advice of pretty much everyone I talked to.",50.0,50-55
10,Elon_Musk,10_16,One friend made sit down and watch a bunch of videos of rockets blowing up. Let me tell you he wasn't far wrong. It was tough going there in the beginning. Because I never built anything physical. I mean I built like a model rocket as a kid and that kind of thing.,53.33,50-55
10,Elon_Musk,10_17,"But I never had a company that built any physical. So, I had to figure out how to do all these things and bring together the right team of people. And we did all that, and then, failed three times. It was tough, tough going. Because the thing about a rocket is, the passing grade is 100%.",56.67,55-60
10,Elon_Musk,10_18,"And you don't get to actually test the rocket in the real environment that is going to be in. So, I think to the best analogy for rocket engineers is, if you want to create a really complicated beta software, you can't run the software as an integrated whole, and you can't run it on the computer, it's intended to run on. For the first time you put it all together and run it on that computer, it must run with no bugs. That's basically the essence of it. So, we missed the mark there.",60.0,60-65

And we were able to, eventually with the fourth flight in 2008, reach orbit. That was also with the last bit of money that we had. Thank goodness that happened.",66.67,65-70
10,Elon_Musk,10_21,"I think the saying is 'fourth time is the charm?' So, we got the Falcon 1 to orbit. And then, began to scale it up to the Falcon 9 which is about an order of magnitude more thrust, it's around a million pounds of thrust. We managed to get that to orbit, and then developed the Dragon spacecraft, which recently was able to dock and returned to earth from the space station. Thanks.",70.0,70-75
10,Elon_Musk,10_22,That was a white-knuckle event. It is a huge relief. I still can't believe it actually happened. But there's lot more that must happen beyond this in order for humanity to become a spacefaring civilization and ultimately a multi-planet species. And that's something I think it's vitally important.,73.33,70-75
10,Elon_Musk,10_23,"And I hope that some of you will participate in that either at SpaceX or other companies. Because it's just really one of the most important things for the preservation and extension of consciousness. It's worth noting as I'm sure people are aware that Earth has been around for 4 billion years, but civilization in terms of having writing has been about 10,000 years, and that's being generous. So, it's really somewhat of a tenuous existence that civilization and consciousness has been on earth. I'm actually fairly optimistic about the future of earth.",76.67,75-80
10,Elon_Musk,10_24,"I don't want to people sort of have the wrong impression like we're all about to die. I think things will most likely be okay for a long time on earth. Not for sure, but, most likely. But even if it's 99% likely, a 1% chance is still worth spending a fair bit of effort to ensure that we have — back up the biosphere, and planetary redundancy if you will. And I think it's really quite important.",80.0,80-85
10,Elon_Musk,10_25,"And in order to do that, there's breakthrough that needs to occur which is to create a rapidly and completely reusable transport system to Mars, which is one of those things that's right on the borderline of even impossible. But that's the sort of the thing that we're going to try to achieve with SpaceX. And then, on the Tesla front, the goal with Tesla was really to try to show what electric cars can do. Because people had the wrong impression, and we had to change people's perceptions of electric vehicle. Because they used to think of it as something that was slow and ugly, with low range, like a golf cart.",83.33,80-85
10,Elon_Musk,10_26,"So, that's why we created the Tesla Roadster, to show that it can be fast, attractive and long range. And it's amazing how — even though you can show that something works on paper, and the calculations are very clear, until you actually have the physical object, and they can drive it, it doesn't really sink in for people. So that I think is something worth nothing. If you're going to create a company, the first thing you should try to do is create a working prototype. Everything looks great on PowerPoint.",86.67,85-90
10,Elon_Musk,10_27,"You can make anything work on PowerPoint. But, if you have an actual demonstration article, even if it's in primitive form, that's much more effective in convincing people. So, we made the Tesla Roadster, and now we're coming out soon with model S, which is a 4-door sedan. Because after we made the Tesla Roadster people said, 'oh sure, sure we always knew you could make a car like that, it's an expensive car and it's low volume and small and all that but can you make a real car?' Okay, fine, we're going to make that, too.",90.0,90-95
10,Elon_Musk,10_28,"So, that's coming out soon. And so that's where things are and hopefully, there are lessons to be drawn there.

At any rate, I decided to do the math for my grandmother. I estimated the number of cigarettes per days, estimated the number of puffs per cigarette and so on. When I was satisfied that I'd come up with a reasonable number, I poked my head into the front of the car, tapped my grandmother on the shoulder, and proudly proclaimed, ""At two minutes per puff, you've taken nine years off your life!""

So I hope that this is a struggle that I'm not the only one facing. Does anyone kind of feel me on this? All right, alhamdulillah, that's good.",11.76,10-15
13,Shereen_Salama,13_5,"I actually have a story that kind of just goes along with this. One of my halka students actually came up to me the other day, actually this was a couple months ago. And she was like, so Shereen, when you go home, do you just eat dates and drink Zem-Zem? And I was like, no, homegirl, I eat cereal in the morning and I eat burgers for lunch and I eat koshari for dinner. You know, I'm normal.",14.71,10-15
13,Shereen_Salama,13_6,"You know, just because I'm at the Masjid doesn't mean that I eat something different or I breathe a different type of oxygen than you do. And unfortunately, you know, when we work in these types of organizations or in our Masjid, people start to look at you and think that you truly are not human. Or that there's, you know, something superhuman about you. So that's kind of the thing that I want to address today is what do we do when we feel like the person in the mirror is different than the person everyone else sees? So subhanAllah, you know, something that we have to do is first try to understand whether those people are two different people.",17.65,15-20
13,Shereen_Salama,13_7,Whether the person that you see in the mirror is truly different than the person that your community sees. Or whether you're just being too harsh on yourself and you truly are amazing. Or whether you're thinking of yourself too highly and you really should start to reconsider some of the things you've done. And so I kind of came up with a litmus test as to what you can ask yourself to try to understand whether those two people are really two people or if they're one.,20.59,20-25
13,Shereen_Salama,13_8,"And the first question that you can ask yourself is, and I want you guys to think about this, if I were to go up to someone in your community whom you work with, or if I were to go up to someone, you know, on your Shura in the MSA, or someone in your Masjid that you work with, or someone that you've mentored in a halaqah, or someone that you work with at work, you know, your co-resident, or whatever it may be. And I were to ask them, you know, tell me about Shereen. Like what is Shereen like? What does Shereen, when you're with Shereen, how do you feel? When these people are with you, how do they feel when you're around them?",23.53,20-25
13,Shereen_Salama,13_9,"And think of that answer. If I were to go up to someone at work or someone that you work with, what would they describe you as? Okay, think about that in your mind. Now if I were to go and ask your sibling at home, or ask your mother, or ask your father, or ask your brother, what is Shereen like to you? How do you feel when Shereen is around you?",26.47,25-30
13,Shereen_Salama,13_10,"How does Shereen make you feel? Do you get a different answer? Is it that the people outside think something of you, and when you treat them, you treat them a certain way, yet you go home and you treat the people at home differently? And if you find that those two answers are different, then know that there is a problem. And again, I wrote this because I need the answer, and I'm saying this to myself before anyone, my mother's in the audience and she can attest to this.",29.41,25-30
13,Shereen_Salama,13_11,"But I'm sure many of us can look within ourselves and say, you know what, those two answers are different. The person that I am on the outside is different than the one I am at home. The person that the community sees of me is different than the one that my mother sees of me. And the Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, told us, he said, خيركم خيركم لأهلي وأنا خيركم لأهلي He said that the best among you are the best to your family, and I am the best to my family.",32.35,30-35
13,Shereen_Salama,13_12,"Why does the Hadith not say خيركم خيركم the best of you are the best to your communities, or the best of you are the ones who give the best speeches, or the best of you are the ones who give the best حلقات, or the best of you are the best at work? Because it's really easy to be good outside. It's really easy to be nice to the people at work because if you're not, they're going to subtweet you on Twitter. And if you're not, they're going to think you're terrible, and they're going to have this illusion of who you are, and they're going to talk bad about you. But if you do something bad to your mom, she's not going to disown you, I hope.",35.29,35-40
13,Shereen_Salama,13_13,"You know, if you're disrespecting your sister, she's still going to be your sister. But if you do something bad on the outside, you can potentially ruin a relationship. And so that's why it's easy for us to be good on the outside, but it's hard to be good at home. And that's why the Hadith goes that the best of you are the best to your family, because your true character comes out at home. When you've had a long day at work, or a long day at school, you face a lot of difficulties, a lot of struggle.",38.24,35-40
13,Shereen_Salama,13_14,"You've had a hard day, and you've tucked it in so no one sees it of you, no one sees the flaws, no one sees the weaknesses. But then you go home and you unleash the monster. You unleash the thing that's been building within you the entire day. And who do you unleash it to? The people that you should care about most.",41.18,40-45
13,Shereen_Salama,13_15,"The people that deserve the most respect from you. You know, and that's what we do. So I need you guys to think about that. And Aisha Radiallahu anha was asked about the Prophet, salallahu alayhi wa sallam. She was asked, you know, we know that the Prophet, Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam, on the outside is amazing.",44.12,40-45
13,Shereen_Salama,13_16,"Tell us about what he's like at home. We don't get to see him at home. Aisha, tell us what he's like at home. And her response was profound, not just in the way that she described the Prophet, but the fact that it came from her. She said, kaana Quranan yamshi, that he was a walking Quran.",47.06,45-50
13,Shereen_Salama,13_17,"He wasn't just a walking Quran when he was at the Masjid. He wasn't just a walking Quran when he gave a halaqa. Not just when he was in the community. He was a walking Quran when he was at home too. The Quran that he was walking, he walked outside and he walked inside.",50.0,50-55
13,Shereen_Salama,13_18,The people who were within his home felt the same way that the people on the outside felt. That's why this is profound. That's why this is important. But I'm sure all of us are trying to be that Quranan yamshi on the outside. We're trying to be that amazing halaqa giver on the outside.,52.94,50-55
13,Shereen_Salama,13_19,"We're trying to be awesome to everyone on the outside, yet to the people at home we don't care. And there's a beautiful line of poetry that I read the other day and it's scary. Listen to this. What good am I if do not… if I do not fill the plates of the ones who fed me but fill the plates of strangers? What good am I if I do not fill the plates of the ones who fed me yet fill the plates of strangers?",55.88,55-60
13,Shereen_Salama,13_20,"What good are you if the one who raised you doesn't see anything from what she's raised you with? What good are you as the one who fed you doesn't see any of the fruits of what she's taught you? The one who spent her blood, sweat, and tears on you for 20, 30 years? And the one who is the reason as to why you are who you are today? The one who helped you get there?",58.82,55-60
13,Shereen_Salama,13_21,"Yet as soon as we get our degree, as soon as we can speak, as soon as we're something to the community, we forget about everyone who taught us. We forget about the people who made us who we are. So that's the first question you want to ask yourself. What does your public self look like versus what does your family see of you? What do the people in the community see versus what does your mother see and what do your siblings see?",61.76,60-65
13,Shereen_Salama,13_22,"And the second question that I want you guys to think of, and again I'm talking to myself before anyone here, is compare what your salah looks like in the Masjid when there's a bunch of people in the congregation versus your salah at home when the only person that can see you is Allah. And I'm sure if we were to think within ourselves, the answer to those two questions, at least for myself, is probably different. That when I'm outside, I'm acting a certain way, yet when I'm inside, I'm not the same. My worship in the eyes of people is not the same as my worship when it's only Allah who's watching me. And the question is why does it matter who's watching when Allah was watching in both?",64.71,60-65
13,Shereen_Salama,13_23,"Why does it matter who else is around you when Allah was always around you? If you guys were at the session right before this, Sheikh Tariq Mustaq mentioned a beautiful story and I'm going to share it so if you heard it, I'm sorry that I'm repeating but he talked about how when he was 16, you know, he became like a Quran assistant in his Masjid and he was teaching alongside of like this awesome Sheikh, right? He was talking about how he was 16, teaching Quran and he felt like a G. He was like, man, I'm like awesome, you know, I'm 16 and I'm teaching Quran to other people. And so one day, I guess he went to the Masjid early, like before fajr or something, and he went and he found that his Sheikh's car was parked outside the Masjid but all the lights were closed.",67.65,65-70
13,Shereen_Salama,13_24,"So he was like, okay, that's kind of weird. And he mentioned that, you know, he had to go make wudu so he walks into the bathroom only to find that his scholar, his teacher, one who was taught by many righteous, amazing scholars before him, was on his knees cleaning the toilet of the Masjid. And so Sheikh Tariq Mustaq goes to him and he's like, Sheikh, like what are you doing? You're an amazing Sheikh, you learned with this person and you learned with that and your status is this, like how are you on your knees cleaning the Masjid? And his response was profound.",70.59,70-75
13,Shereen_Salama,13_25,"He says, this is the work that the one who sees always sees. This is the work that when no one else saw you, Allah saw it. Because what we do is we love to be the one with the microphone, we love to be the one who everyone can attribute things to, we love to be the one with the title, you know, I love to be quoted, I love for people to know who I am. Yet Allah sees the things that no one else sees. The things that you thought no one saw.",73.53,70-75
13,Shereen_Salama,13_26,"When you did the dishes and your mom didn't tell you thank you, Allah saw that. You know, when you picked something off the floor and no one saw it, Allah saw that. The reason why we do things in the community is because we love that recognition, we love for people to pat us on the back and say good job. We love the volunteer appreciation, Jannah, we love that. But realize you're not always going to get it",76.47,75-80
13,Shereen_Salama,13_27,"and sometimes it's better for you that only Allah saw. And it could be that that deed that you did in secret that no one saw besides Allah is the reason why you entered Jannah. And everything that you've done in the public, everything that people saw, everything that was out in the open was stuff that you did for the wrong reasons and you never know that may not even count for you. So this is kind of our thought process in understanding whether or not we have this problem. Now once you find out you have the problem, what do I do?",79.41,75-80
13,Shereen_Salama,13_28,"What's the solution? So a couple things I was thinking about is if you feel like people are holding you up to this standard, you know, you are this and this and this and you have this title and this title and this title and you're amazing, challenge yourself to live up to that standard that people are holding you to. You know, if you go home and you say man, people think I'm great but I'm actually not, try to actually be great.",82.35,80-85
13,Shereen_Salama,13_29,"And it's not for the people, it's not for people to say you know, Shereen Salama was great but it's for me to improve myself so Allah can say Shereen Salama was great. For me to take the standard that you put me at and to try to actually achieve it, not for you but for Allah. And the second thing is that for every public deed that you do in the eyes of people that you double that in your private… in your private life, in your private ibadah. That man if you prayed in the Masjid, try to pray at home when no one else can see you besides Allah.",85.29,85-90
13,Shereen_Salama,13_30,"Try to wake up when everyone's asleep in the dark, just you and Allah, create that relationship. And the third, and this is a dua that was taught to us by Abu Bakr radiallahu anhu, he used to receive praise and there was this beautiful dua that he used to say. And it goes, Allahumma ghfir li ma la ya'lamun waj'alni khairan min ma ya'dunnoon.",88.24,85-90
13,Shereen_Salama,13_31,"Which translates to, oh Allah forgive me for what they do not know about me and make me better than what they think that I am. Because it's funny we like to cover up the fact that all of us have a hidden past. All of us have some secret, all of us have some sin, all of us have something that we've done that no one else knows. But remember that when you're being praised that you once were in that state. Not to put yourself down",91.18,90-95
13,Shereen_Salama,13_32,but for you to remember that Allah is the one who brought you there. And finally and I'll conclude in reminding us that this is a journey. This by no means is something that we are going to accomplish. It's going to be a constant struggle. But at least when we die we'll be dying on the path and struggle for the sake of Allah Subhanu wa Ta'ala.,94.12,90-95
13,Shereen_Salama,13_33,So I ask Allah Subhanu wa Ta'ala to make us among those who can improve upon ourselves and to make the journey to him easy. SubhanakAllahumma bihamdik nashadu an la ilaha illa anta nastaqfiruka wa natubu ilayk. Bi salamu alaikum wa rahmatullah.,97.06,95-100
14,Angelina_Jolie,14_0,"Hello. Under-Secretary General, Foreign and Defence Ministers, Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, This is the third UN Defense Peacekeeping Ministerial I have attended, but the first on my home soil. I am very proud to speak here as an American. I am a patriot. I love my country and want to see it thrive.",0.0,0-5
14,Angelina_Jolie,14_1,"I also believe strongly in an America that is part of an international community. Countries working together on an equal footing is how we reduce the risk of conflict. It is how we avoid the need to send men and women of our militaries to fight and sacrifice overseas. The UN was set up for that purpose. As a way of resolving differences peacefully, supporting each other's prosperity, and extending universal rights and freedoms.",5.56,5-10
14,Angelina_Jolie,14_2,"It is in all our interests for the UN to be made effective, brought closer to the lives of citizens, and not ever misused. At a deeper level, a country that believes that all men and women are born free and equal cannot be true to itself if it doesn't defend those principles for all people, wherever they live, regardless their circumstances, and no matter how desperate their struggle. In fact, our support should be strongest where rights are threatened the most. We seem incapable of upholding minimum standards of humanity in many parts of the world. That this comes at a time when humankind is richer, and more technologically advanced than ever before, is all the more painful.",11.11,10-15
14,Angelina_Jolie,14_3,"Eighteen years ago, when I first began working with the UN Refugee Agency, there were just under 20 million displaced people worldwide, and the numbers were falling. Today there are over 65 million people displaced, and the numbers are rising. More countries are experiencing some form of violent conflict today than any time in the last thirty years. UN peacekeepers now comprise of the second largest group of forces deployed overseas, and are often required to serve where there is little or no peace to be kept. Against this backdrop, it is easy to dismiss our institutions as flawed or ineffective.",16.67,15-20
14,Angelina_Jolie,14_4,"My hope, instead, is that young people in particular will feel inspired to join the effort to improve them: to join the 'men and women in the arena', to paraphrase President Roosevelt, 'who strive — are striving — to do deeds, and whose faces are marred by dust and sweat and blood'. In that regard, I want to express my respect for men and women who serve as peacekeepers, and for those who have been killed or injured. The protection of civilians is the primary responsibility of governments. When UN peacekeepers are deployed, it is usually where a government is unable or unwilling to protect civilian life. Those United Nations missions often represent the last and only hope for millions of people facing daily threats to their safety and their basic rights.",22.22,20-25
14,Angelina_Jolie,14_5,"The need for peacekeeping troops to have the best possible training and equipment and the highest standards of personal conduct becomes obvious when measured against that weighty responsibility. That is why this meeting is so important, because it is in the hands of the governments you represent to enable peacekeeping to live up to its ideals and the needs of our time. So, as you discuss how to strengthen UN peacekeepers and give peacekeepers the capabilities they need to operate in today's dangerous environments, I ask you to take time to consider this question from the perspective of women. Around the world there are countless examples of women rising, leading, taking their destiny into their own hands, inspiring us all. But women and girls are still the majority of the victims of war.",27.78,25-30
14,Angelina_Jolie,14_6,"They are over half of all refugees, and the vast majority of the victims of rape and other sexual and gender-based violence. Women are at the absolute epicenter of modern conflict, in the worst possible sense. But more often than not they are still on the outside looking in when it comes to politics and decisions about their futures. If we went by the principle that those affected by a problem should be in charge of determining the solution, then the majority of the world's peace negotiators, foreign ministers and diplomats would be women. We all know the reality.",33.33,30-35
14,Angelina_Jolie,14_7,"In Afghanistan, thousands of women have recently come together in public, risking their lives, to ask that their rights and the rights of their children be guaranteed in peace negotiations that so far they have been allowed no part of. Their stand is inspiring, but it should not be necessary and the international community's silent response is alarming to say the least. There can be no peace and stability in Afghanistan, or anywhere else in the world, that involves trading away the rights of women. Worse still we see impunity for crimes committed against women and girls during conflict, or when women human rights defenders are attacked, or killed, or imprisoned. Too often, whether or not we confront these human rights violations depends not on the law, on universal standards, but on how much our governments think that their business or political interests in that country might be affected.",38.89,35-40
14,Angelina_Jolie,14_8,"This is as harmful to our long-term security and stability as it is unacceptable on a human and moral level. None of this is to discount the efforts of the many men, great husbands, fathers, brothers and sons, who have been with us in this fight. It is simply the reality of the unequal power relations, abuse of power, gender bias, violence and lack of justice that keep so many women in a subordinate, and therefore vulnerable, position internationally. As long as we continue to put almost every other issue ahead of women's rights and participation, we will remain stuck in a cycle of violence and conflict. We will have learned nothing.",44.44,40-45
14,Angelina_Jolie,14_9,"And our institutions will count for less than they should. From my experience, a growing number of men and women in uniform understand this. When we are at our best, doing what we are called to do, we all share the exact same goals. The same mandate. A safer, more stable world.",50.0,50-55
14,Angelina_Jolie,14_10,"We fight to defend our freedoms and rights and the freedoms and rights of others. I recently met a male peacekeeper, who had just returned from deployment as a gender adviser in the Central African Republic. He told me that when he had started his career serving in Afghanistan, he considered women's rights to be a ""soft"" issue and not what war was fought for. But his experiences had made him understand that it is exactly what should be fought for, and exactly what stabilizes a country. His ability to contribute to this goal became a source of pride to him.",55.56,55-60
14,Angelina_Jolie,14_11,"He had made that jump in his thinking. And while he had been doing a great service to his country already, he had now added that understanding and that sense of partnership with the women he served. There is progress. The number of cases of alleged sexual exploitation and abuse are down, although even a single case is unacceptable. The numbers of women peacekeepers is on the rise, with African nations in particular leading the way on this.",61.11,60-65
14,Angelina_Jolie,14_12,"There are more gender advisers on UN missions, although still not enough. And improved the training on the protection of civilians is starting to come into effect. But there is still a long way to go to demonstrate that anyone who commits violations will not be tolerated and will be investigated and prosecuted without exception. There is still much more to do to increase the number of women in the ranks of peacekeeping missions. Having met some formidable female peacekeepers this morning I think this change cannot come soon enough for the effectiveness and impact of missions.",66.67,65-70
14,Angelina_Jolie,14_13,"And of course, we cannot call for more women to serve, without making it safe and viable for them to do so, including ensuring that they themselves are not vulnerable to sexual harassment or abuse. New actions by your governments in all these areas can make a huge difference. But they, I believe must be accompanied by commitments to ensure women's representation in peace negotiations. To be consistent in the defense of women's rights, in all places, and to address the deep-seated societal reasons for inequality and violence against women. And above all we need an understand that women themselves are protectors: As mothers.",72.22,70-75
14,Angelina_Jolie,14_14,"As peacekeepers. As human rights defenders. Women are already contributing to peace in theatres of war across the world without recognition or glory, because it comes naturally to them. It's important to them. Think how much more we could achieve with women's equal participation in all aspects of society.",77.78,75-80
14,Angelina_Jolie,14_15,"Not at the expense of men, but alongside men. Because we are all partners in this life. We humans are capable of horrors, and unspeakable cruelty. But we are also capable of building civilizations, improving laws, demanding justice. We are willing to fight for people we've never met and for their families.",83.33,80-85
14,Angelina_Jolie,14_16,"We fall. We fail. We lose our way, often when we are made to feel afraid. But in our moments of strength and clarity, we know that all people are in fact equal. We know that while we can and should be proud of who we are individually, we are a part of a global world.",88.89,85-90
14,Angelina_Jolie,14_17,And we know that we are supposed to come together in defense of something greater than ourselves. Thank you very much.,94.44,90-95

16,Kate_Winslet,16_1,"Our mum was just our mum, a great cook and storyteller. Sometimes worked in a local sandwich shop. My dad was a postman, a van driver, a tarmac shoveler, a Christmas tree seller and he did many other odd jobs along the way to make ends meet. He was also an actor. Yes he was.",2.33,0-5
16,Kate_Winslet,16_2,"More out of work than in it but he always loved it. And even though he rarely made any money from it he still loved it. He was happy and it made me want to be an actor too. At school I wasn't very good at maths, I was okay at English, pretty rubbish at history but the thing I loved, I loved was drama.",4.65,0-5
16,Kate_Winslet,16_3,"It was my passion. Yes, it was my passion. I was always auditioning for the school plays, I didn't really get very good parts mind you but I didn't mind, I didn't care. I would often get cast as the crocodile or the scarecrow or the daft fairy.",6.98,5-10
16,Kate_Winslet,16_4,"I was even a dancing frog once. But it didn't matter, I still loved it, I loved acting. It didn't matter how big or small the parts were. I wanted to be great and I was determined to keep learning.",9.3,5-10
16,Kate_Winslet,16_5,"So I did my GCSEs, I did okay. Nothing in life comes for free, my dad would say. Do good work. I tried my best, I did good work. I got an A star for drama, it was the only A I got.",11.63,10-15
16,Kate_Winslet,16_6,"I got my A, oh yeah. But what was I going to do now? How was I going to realise my dream of being on stage? I never even dared to think about being in films.",13.95,10-15
16,Kate_Winslet,16_7,"So first things first, I got a job at the same sandwich shop as my mum. That way I could save enough money each week to pay for the train fares to London to go on auditions. I didn't get that many auditions back then. And it was tough, I never got the parts. I tried so hard to get them",16.28,15-20
16,Kate_Winslet,16_8,"but I never got them and I was always comparing myself to others. You see I'd been bullied at school, they called me blubber. They teased me for wanting to act, locked me in the cupboard, laughed at me. I wasn't the prettiest, I've always had big feet.",18.6,15-20
16,Kate_Winslet,16_9,"And I was even told that I might be lucky in my acting if I was happy to settle for the fat girl parts. Ever let go, never let go. And they would say, you're just not really what we're looking for Kate. And so I'd hear that a lot. And so these comments about how I looked started to crop up and I'd never really dared to think about how I looked before.",20.93,20-25
16,Kate_Winslet,16_10,"I was just kind of ordinary, nothing special. But this unkindness made me feel truly horrendous. I felt I wasn't enough, I wasn't good enough, I didn't look right. And all because I didn't fit into someone else's idea of perfect. I didn't have the perfect body and I would rarely hear anything positive.",23.26,20-25
16,Kate_Winslet,16_11,"So I started to feel, I started to feel uncomfortable in my own skin. It made it hard, I wanted to give up. Maybe I should rethink this acting thing I said to myself. But it was my passion and it made me happy. And surely nobody can take my happiness away.",25.58,25-30
16,Kate_Winslet,16_12,"So I had to rise above it, I had to dig deep, be strong. Because deep down I wanted to play Sandy in Grease. And I wanted to be Annie. And I wanted to be Maria in West Side Story. I wanted to be in the world of my dreams on stage.",27.91,25-30
16,Kate_Winslet,16_13,I was done with being told I looked wrong. I was done with being told I didn't fit that perfect mould. I wanted to be an actress and nothing was going to stop me. So what did I do? What did I do?,30.23,30-35
16,Kate_Winslet,16_14,I didn't lock myself away and give up on my dream. I fought back. I had to ignore the negative comments. I had to believe in myself. I had to choose to rise above it all.,32.56,30-35
16,Kate_Winslet,16_15,"And I had to work hard. You have to be indestructible to do what you love. And believe that you are worth it. Yes, believe that you are worth it. And sometimes that's the hardest part.",34.88,30-35
16,Kate_Winslet,16_16,"Wrong hair, big feet, wrong face, too ordinary, not right, don't fit, next. And I was the W in the alphabet. So I came last. I was always stuck at the end of the queue. But I stayed focused until W was called out and it was my turn.",37.21,35-40

16,Kate_Winslet,16_25,"I use my phone all the time, whether it's to take photos, like most of us do, or text my mum, or look up directions. But today, social media robs us of so many of us of just basic conversation. We're constantly distracted from being our true selves in a world that is fuelled by Insta-tweet-book-face, as I like to call it. So ask yourself, ask yourself, is your phone making you, helping you to be happy? Are you using it?",58.14,55-60
16,Kate_Winslet,16_26,"Are you using it in the correct way for you? Are all those fantastic people you follow, are they having a better time than you, really? Are they making you feel unsettled or unsatisfied? Does it dent your self-esteem not to get those likes? Does it chip away at your true self?",60.47,60-65
16,Kate_Winslet,16_27,Is it even the real you? Maybe that person is a role. Perhaps you're losing a bit of yourself. Think about that. Let's think about that.,62.79,60-65
16,Kate_Winslet,16_28,"I get to play roles, but they aren't real people. They really aren't. I get red carpets, it's fun, it's fun to dress up, wear lipstick, but it isn't sustainable. It's not the real me. And being a real person is full of much more complex moments.",65.12,65-70
16,Kate_Winslet,16_29,"The me that results from my life experiences, and having my eyes open, my heart broken, and from being told that I wasn't quite right to do what I loved, is the person that has made me who I am today, talking to you with all my flaws and all my imperfections. And so perhaps for some of you, the persona that you found yourself creating online is just a version of perfect, and maybe that's hard to step away from. So let's take that energy and time, that precious time that you use, and let's use that effort and make social media a good thing. Let's make it a great thing, a thing that can be a voice for change and inspiration. Let's stand in the way of letting it make us feel bad about ourselves.",67.44,65-70

Well, I have traveled the world. And I have spoken to millions of people, but that's not the most important thing, the success that I had the most important thing is that what she taught me, what she told me that day has stayed with me since.

If you're anything like me you may find yourself constantly overwhelmed by everything that's wrong with politics. And when I say politics I'm not talking about Democrats or Republicans. I'm talking about the flaws that exist in our political system regardless of which party is in power. And I know, it's hard to talk about politics these days, but look: The government is ours.",0.0,0-5
18,Jennifer_Lawrence,18_1,"We pay for it, so it needs to work for us. And right now it doesn't. And I mean it really doesn't. So, what's going on here? Is it Russian meddling and social media?",4.17,0-5
18,Jennifer_Lawrence,18_2,Is it him? Is it her? No. Those two were the least popular presidential candidates since they began keeping track of such things. Only 4% of Americans have a great deal of confidence in Congress now.,8.33,5-10
18,Jennifer_Lawrence,18_3,"Just 4%. America is no longer even considered a full democracy. We are witnessing total political system failure in America. Which is the complete opposite of what our nation's founders had in mind. So I'm going to show you three lines that show what's causing this failure, how we can fix it, and what you can do about it.",12.5,10-15
18,Jennifer_Lawrence,18_4,"So, here's your first line. What I want you to do is take any issue you really care about and picture it on this line. This line comes from a Princeton University study that shows how public opinion influences the laws that Congress does or doesn't pass. They looked at eighteen-hundred public opinion polls over a twenty-year period, and we took their data and plotted it in this chart. See this horizontal line?",16.67,15-20
18,Jennifer_Lawrence,18_5,"That shows public support for a law amongst average Americans. This vertical line? That shows the likelihood of the public support leading to the passage of a law. When you plot it for the average American, you get a line that looks like this. There's your issue sitting on that line.",20.83,20-25
18,Jennifer_Lawrence,18_6,"If there is zero support for a law, there's about a 30% chance that Congress is going to pass it. And if there's 100% support for something, the most popular thing ever, there's still a 30% chance that Congress is gonna pass it. So the line is horizontal because no matter how much support there is among average Americans, there's still a 30% chance that Congress is gonna pass that law. Princeton determined that the ""preferences of the average American appear to have only a minuscule, near-zero, statistically non-significant impact on public policy."" How in the hell does this happen?",25.0,25-30
18,Jennifer_Lawrence,18_7,"Consider this. Politicians are spending up to 70% of their time raising funds for re-election after they get into office. Why? Because in order to win a seat in the Senate in some races, you would have to raise $45,000 every single day, 365 days a year for 6 years to raise enough money to win. Now consider that only .05% of Americans give more than $10,000 to politics, and then you see why politicians have become completely dependent on that .05% of Americans (billionaires and special-interest groups!) who fund their campaigns.",29.17,25-30
18,Jennifer_Lawrence,18_8,"Meanwhile, you've got lobbyists writing our laws and donating to the politicians who pass them, we have a two-party duopoly of Democrats and Republicans that makes it so that independents can't win, while the American people are leaving the major parties in droves. As you can see here, nearly half of American voters are now registered independent. And then there's gerrymandering, with politicians drawing the boundaries of their own voting districts into crazy shapes designed to prevent competition. Today only 14% of House campaigns are actually competitive. 86% of them are not.",33.33,30-35
18,Jennifer_Lawrence,18_9,"And we wonder why young people feel that their vote doesn't matter. I've covered a lot here, but it all adds up to this vast ring of influence over our elected leaders. It's a corrupt system in which ""We the people"" have ""near zero"" influence over our own government… And that.. is sad…. That is not the country I feel like I grew up in. But what's worse is that by allowing this to happen we are causing the failure of the most important issues facing our nation.",37.5,35-40
18,Jennifer_Lawrence,18_10,We're wasting trillions of dollars a year on fraud and abuse in our own government. One in five American children live in poverty. Our healthcare is the most expensive in the world. We have more people in prison per capita than Russia and China. We're losing jobs to the rest of the world.,41.67,40-45
18,Jennifer_Lawrence,18_11,"And we're not even doing enough to keep our air and our water clean for our children. America was founded on the promise of self governance. But instead we have statistically non-significant impact on public policy. So, first of all, the US Constitution gives states sole control over how elections are run — even federal elections — so when we fix gerrymandering or election laws, that fixes the federal election in each state. That means that by going state-by-state, we have an immediate impact on how we elect Congress and how we hold them accountable.",45.83,45-50
18,Jennifer_Lawrence,18_12,"But there's more… and that brings us to our second line. This line is from a Bloomberg News study. It finds that throughout American history, passing state laws leads to federal victory. Let me show you what I mean.

18,Jennifer_Lawrence,18_13,"When it hits the right side of the chart, that's the federal victory. Okay, now I want you to watch the blue line. We're gonna do this again with interracial marriage. There were a few states in the Northeast that made it legal, decades ago, and centuries go by and we hit this blue line where all of a sudden there's a rush of activity, which leads pretty quickly to federal passage. So here we are again, with same-sex marriage.",54.17,50-55
18,Jennifer_Lawrence,18_14,"One state, Massachusetts, for many years. A couple decades later we hit that blue line: a jump in state activity and federal passage. This isn't about these issues. This is about a winning political strategy.

18,Jennifer_Lawrence,18_15,"So, fixing this problem IS possible. But how do we create our trigger moment for this issue? Well, the ""Grassroots Campaign"" from the study? That's RepresentUs.

And as you can see, its 25% liberal, 36% conservative, and 34% moderate.

I just had to say that one more time.",70.83,70-75
18,Jennifer_Lawrence,18_18,"And you're just not gonna change the political power structure of America with 25% of the people. Fixing corruption requires that we enlist all Americans, liberals, conservatives, and moderates who, as we've shown, overwhelmingly support reform. Number two, corruption. When we talk about money in politics, gerrymandering, democracy, campaign finance reform… most people just tune out, but people are fired up about corruption. And number three, we must build a movement.",75.0,75-80

And if we can get those 85 wins to 850 wins, we can fix our corrupt political system, save America, and get to work on fixing everything else that's broken in our country. This is how we build this movement big enough to trigger that ""rush of state activity that leads to a change in federal law…."" And that brings us to our last line. Right now this is you and right now these are all of the ways that you can help us go state-by-state, city-by-city to fix the corruption in American politics.",83.33,80-85

He becomes historic in just that one moment.",3.7,0-5
19,R_Madhavan,19_2,"There is a huge lesson to be learned on things like that. Everybody keeps saying: ""Success is when, is when you, when the right opportunity meets the right preparation."" Right?

But what makes the right opportunity and the right preparation come together?",7.41,5-10
19,R_Madhavan,19_3,"When does that synergy happen for you to be prepared for it? Because like they say, if you're prepared but you don't get the opportunity, it's useless. If you had the opportunity and are prepared, it's not useless, but they have to meet at a point, right? And that meeting happens because you will it to happen because you wanted so badly to happen.",11.11,10-15
19,R_Madhavan,19_4,"I could be walking down any street, I could be anybody, but why did that one director come and meet me and wanted me to act in that television serial? If you look at every next step in my career, I have never prepared for it. I have never imagined that this could happen. I never imagined that Mani Ratnam would call me. How would Mani Ratnam know about a guy who's doing a television series in Bombay without even seeing one episode of mine?",14.81,10-15
19,R_Madhavan,19_5,"So let's come back to that one point that happens. The synergy that happens between the right opportunity and the right preparation. And that happens when you have what is called situational awareness. So let me tell you a little bit about situational awareness. Situational awareness is when in the, as in the army, they say, ""You're completely aware of what is happening around you at all times.""",18.52,15-20
19,R_Madhavan,19_6,"So as I was saying, the situational awareness happens when you are completely aware of everything that is going around you at all times and you should be able to do that. When we are in the army and you are walking down the ground, parede ground around anybody who's involved with the defense will know what I'm saying is the truth. And if there is an officer walking away from the other side of the ground, you have to stop and say to them and say: ""Ram Ram sirji"" or whatever is the call of the unit. If you don't, they give you a brick in your hand and you have to shave with that brick. So… thank you, that's awesome.",22.22,20-25
19,R_Madhavan,19_7,"So what, the situation awareness is because you should know when the enemies around you, when there is danger around you. You know how that is taught to you from when you're a child. That's taught to you in the form of good manners. In the form of being courteous. So",25.93,25-30
19,R_Madhavan,19_8,"when, when you say a ""good morning"" or you're saying a ""good afternoon"" or you're looking around and helping a teacher who's carrying a book and being aware that she needs help, or you're watching around and stepping over a train and not tripping on yourself. You should know that you're fairly evolved in the form of… in the art of situational awareness. That's why people insist on teaching children good manners. And anybody who has good manners, it's not just a desire, it's not the desire just to be considered to be a polite guy, but the ability to know when somebody needs to be reached. Somebody needs help.",29.63,25-30
19,R_Madhavan,19_9,"Somebody is in need of assistance or somebody has to run away. And that's, that's why you teach your child good manners. And I will tell you today from the bottom of my heart, I might not be completely worthy of some of the opportunities that I got when I grabbed it like hell and I got those opportunities simply because I was a very well-mannered person. I was able to…",33.33,30-35
19,R_Madhavan,19_10,"Yeah. So… And with that manner, with the way you walk, with your gait, the kind of words that you use. It's very common to use normal language with your friends and everything, but most people don't even have a vocabulary. The reason I started those classes in Kolhapur was so that I had my friends who came to me and said: ""Maddy, we are very good engineers, buddy. We are really good at what we're doing.",37.04,35-40

So then I said the fault lies with you guys.",40.74,40-45
19,R_Madhavan,19_12,"You have to break the clutter. Nobody's going to come and say, ""Hey, you know what? Maybe you're going to let me give you a shot."" You have to be noticed in that very first instant. And for two reasons: one is that either you should know what is your good… what is a good profession for you.",44.44,40-45
19,R_Madhavan,19_13,"If you're not able to make an impression, then quickly change it. This is not the be-all and end-all. The engineering or whichever subject that you choose to major in when you are in college does not literally have to be your lifelong profession, but give it a shot. At least know if that is a profession that you really want to pursue and excel in, because that's the only way you'll survive is if you excel in it. If you excel in it to such an extent that you think sleep, dream, eat, breathe that particular job.",48.15,45-50

That myth is that gayness orbits around straightness, transgender orbits around cis-gender, and that all races orbit around whiteness.",35.71,35-40
21,Anne_Hathaway,21_6,"It's wrong, but this myth is too real for too many. It is ancient, so it is trusted. It is a habit, so it's assumed to be the way things are. It's inherited, so it's thought immutable. It's consequences are dangerous because it prioritizes a certain type of love, a certain kind of body, a certain kind of skin color and does not value in the same way anything it deems to be other to itself.",42.86,40-45
21,Anne_Hathaway,21_7,"It is a myth that is with us from birth, and it is a myth that keeps money and power in the hands of the few instead of being invested in the lives of the free. I appreciate this community so much because it's where I learned to reject this myth. I appreciate this community because together we are not just going to question this myth, we are going to destroy it. Authentic equality, authentic equality doesn't prioritize sexual orientation. It doesn't put anyone's gender or race at the center.",50.0,50-55
21,Anne_Hathaway,21_8,"It doesn't erase our identities either. What it does do is centralize love. And when love is fully centralized, every door opens for everybody. Now I know I'm speaking in abstractions and that there is privilege embedded in my ability to do so. I know that there are very real obstacles that block the path to true equality.",57.14,55-60
21,Anne_Hathaway,21_9,"And I know that removing them is easier said than done, but I also know that myths are destroyed by the same thing that creates them, a community. A community that believes, a community that is conscious, a community that collapse back and says no more, a community backed by the HRC. Can you imagine what would happen as each person follows the lead of this community and rejects the myth of their own unworthiness? And more importantly, the myth that they need others to be worth less in order for them to be worth more. The walls built in fear will crumble.",64.29,60-65
21,Anne_Hathaway,21_10,"They will disintegrate. The old world will shatter and the pieces that no longer serve will melt. A new world will emerge forged from this community, from their size, from your seismic imperative message that love is love. This community is a community of alchemists. This community has transformed a world full of stark, black and white morality into one, a rainbow prismatic, lustrous freedom.",71.43,70-75
21,Anne_Hathaway,21_11,"This is a community of light keepers, visionaries of worth, of authenticity, and of true power. And this is a community who by asserting its own equality have in these troubled savage times protected what is best about all of us. This community has arrived because this community understands innately that equality is not a destination. It is a choice. Love is love, and equality just is.",78.57,75-80

So, let me say for everyone whose lives that you have made better, which is to say, for everyone, thank you. To this beloved community, to Ella, it's an honor to be your ally. This award means so much to me because it comes from you.",85.71,85-90

22,Nelson_Mandela,22_0,"Ladies and Gentlemen. This may very well be our last official visit to the United States before retiring from office next year. There could not been a more moving start to the visit than one which included being honoured in this way by one of the great educational institutions of this nation and of the world. I know that through this award you are not so much recognising any individual achievement, but are rather paying tribute to the struggles and achievements of the South African people as a whole. I humbly accept the award in that spirit, while at the same time wishing you to know that we are not unaware of nor unmoved by the great compliment you pay us by conferring this degree at a specially convened Convocation.",0.0,0-5
22,Nelson_Mandela,22_1,"To join George Washington and Winston Churchill as the other recipients of such an award conferred at a specially convened Convocation, is not only a singular honour. It also holds great symbolic significance: to the mind and to the future memory of this great American institution, the name of an African is now added to those two illustrious leaders of the Western world. If in these latter years of a life lived in pursuit of equality, we can at last look upon our own country as one in which citizens, regardless of race, gender or creed, share equal political rights and opportunities for development, we do so with great gratitude towards the millions upon millions all around the world who materially and morally supported our struggle for freedom and justice. Together with those freedom- and justice-loving citizens of the world, we do at the same time, however, note that at the end of this century – a century which humanity entered with such high hopes for progress – the world is still beset by great disparities between the rich and the poor, both within countries and between different parts of the world. If in individual life we all may reach that part of the long walk where the opportunity is granted to retire to some rest and tranquillity, for humanity the walk to freedom and equality seems, alas, still to be long one ahead.",12.5,10-15
22,Nelson_Mandela,22_2,"This august institution gains its standing and reputation also from the manner in which it has conducted, and continues to conduct, itself as an international presence. Wherever men and women of learning and thought gather, its name and work are known. It embodies that spirit of universality which marks great universities. To join the ranks of its alumni, is to be reminded of the oneness of our global world. The greatest single challenge facing our globalised world is to combat and eradicate its disparities.",25.0,25-30
22,Nelson_Mandela,22_3,"While in all parts of the world progress is being made in entrenching democratic forms of governance, we constantly need to remind ourselves that the freedoms which democracy brings will remain empty shells if they are not accompanied by real and tangible improvements in the material lives of the millions of ordinary citizens of those countries. Where men and women and children go burdened with hunger, suffering from preventable diseases, languishing in ignorance and illiteracy, or finding themselves bereft of decent shelter, talk of democracy and freedom that does not recognise these material aspects, can ring hollow and erode confidence exactly in those values we seek to promote. Hence our universal obligation towards the building of a world in which there shall be greater equality amongst nations and amongst citizens of nations. The disparity between the developed and developing world, between North and South, reflects itself also in the sphere of educational and intellectual resources. When in Africa we speak and dream of, and work for, a rebirth of that continent as a full participant in the affairs of the world in the next century, we are deeply conscious of how dependent that is on the mobilisation and strengthening of the continent's resources of learning.",37.5,35-40
22,Nelson_Mandela,22_4,"The current world financial crisis also starkly reminds us that many of the concepts that guided our sense of how the world and its affairs are best ordered, have suddenly been shown to be wanting. They are seen to have hidden real structural defects in the world economic system. The precepts of the economic theorists who could so confidently prescribe to all, now appear to have drawn much of their apparent intellectual validation from having been unchallenged by the day-to-day operations of a system that operated in the interests of the powerful. Not only does this crisis call for fundamental rethinking and reconceptualisation on the part of the theorists of the North. It more particularly and urgently emphasises the need for thinkers and intellectuals of the developing world to sharpen their skills and analyses, and for a genuine partnership between those of the North and the South in helping shape a world order that answers to the shared and common needs of all peoples, and not just the riches.",50.0,50-55
22,Nelson_Mandela,22_5,"This university already has had a long partnership of learning and teaching with the South African people. There are many names that one could mention of persons now holding office in government or in institutions of civil society who spent time at Harvard or benefited from programmes conducted jointly with this institution. For that, our fledgling democracy faced with enormous tasks of reconstruction and development owes your institution a great debt of gratitude. As South Africans play their role in helping to conceptualise and give content to the African Renaissance, we continue to draw upon the intellectual skills nurtured and honed here. The United States of America and democratic South Africa have in the course of these last four years built a relationship of mutual respect and co-operation, each country respecting the sovereignty of the other while co-operating as partners.",62.5,60-65
22,Nelson_Mandela,22_6,"As part of this relationship the scholars who had the benefit of studying here, returned better equipped to deal with the local challenges and problems as Africans. It is therefore a source of great encouragement and inspiration for us to learn about the ""Emerging Africa"" research project housed in the newly-created Centre for International Development at Harvard. Its objective of undertaking an appraisal of Africa 92s economic, social and political history, as well as the problems facing the continent, is timely and to be greatly welcomed. That it will be doing this in collaboration with African research institutions and scholars, will serve to strengthen and build African intellectual capacity to take charge of its reconstruction and regeneration. I am confident that it will also strengthen and build your own understanding of African reality and your capacity to analyse that reality as part of our shared world.",75.0,75-80
22,Nelson_Mandela,22_7,"Mister President, we accept this great honour bestowed upon us today as a symbol of how South Africa and the United States, Africa and the West, the developing and the developed world, are reaching out and joining hands as partners in building a world order that equally benefits all the nations and people of the world. For three hundred years this great institution has served its nation with distinction. We enter the new millennium in the hope that the rich fruits of learning, science and technological progress will in this coming century truly be shared by all in this global village in which we live. We are confident that this institution of which we are now a proud member will play a leading role in achieving that. Thank you.",87.5,85-90
23,Demi_Lovato,23_0,"Thank you so much. That introduction was really overwhelming and, the most positive way, so thank you. Hi, everyone. My people. It is an honor and a privilege to be here today at NAMI's national day of action.",0.0,0-5
23,Demi_Lovato,23_1,"Looking out at all of you is so inspiring. It is great to see so many people dedicated to improving mental health and the lives of others. Seeing people of awe ages from all over the country come together gives me so much hope that changes is possible. Those of us here today know mental illness has no prejudice. It affects people of every race, age, gender, religion, and economic status.",7.14,5-10
23,Demi_Lovato,23_2,"It doesn't discriminate between republicans or democrats either. That's why we are here today. We need to send a simple message to our nation's leaders, mental health matters, and must be taken seriously. It is time to act for mental health and pass comprehensive mental health bills this year. We're here because groups like NAMI helped us understand that our voices really do matter.",14.29,10-15
23,Demi_Lovato,23_3,"Our stories really do matter. We have the power to make a difference, and we have the personal experience needed to be taken seriously. We know what it means to have our lives, or the lives of people we love get off track because of mental illness. We understand that mental illness is serious and can be absolutely devastating. We also know mental illness can be treatable when we have access to appropriate, comprehensive care.",21.43,20-25
23,Demi_Lovato,23_4,"I know it is largely because of our personal experience with mental illness; each of us is here today. As I learn more about my own illness and the experience of others, I realize how much we all have in common, even if mental illness has made a few headlines because of my career. There is, there's a number of ways in which I have been very lucky, yet, even with access to so much, my journey has not been an easy one by any means. During my darkest times, I didn't know why I was alive, and I definitely didn't like myself. I had very low periods that would so emotionally draining, that I couldn't find the strength to crawl out of bed in the morning.",28.57,25-30
23,Demi_Lovato,23_5,"I was withdrawn, disconnected, and very angry. There were stretches of time where I felt nothing but shame. I would medicate myself with drugs and alcohol, in an effort to feel normal. Not better, just normal. I didn't understand why somebody like me with all the resources and reasons in the world to be emotionally well; I couldn't find happiness.",35.71,35-40
23,Demi_Lovato,23_6,"When I finally got diagnosed with a bipolar disorder, it was a relief in so many ways. It helped me to start make sense of my bipolar depression and all the harmful things I was doing to cope with it. Getting the right diagnosis didn't happen overnight. Through the process of being misdiagnosed and misunderstood, I learned how important it is to be open with your doctor, so you get to the root of what is going on as soon as possible. The journey to living well with bipolar disorder is a process for me involved seeing a therapist, being honest with myself and others, following my treatment plan, and taking care of my victims.",42.86,40-45
23,Demi_Lovato,23_7,"It requires comprehensive care. Living well with bipolar order takes work and doesn't happen at once. There wasn't one day when the light simply came on, I said, I'm cured, I'm better. Sometimes the first, second, or even third medication we try isn't one that works the best. But we owe it to ourselves to keep trying.",50.0,50-55
23,Demi_Lovato,23_8,"The reality is that you're not a car who goes into the shop and gets fixed immediately. You need ongoing maintenance. There will always be work left to do. I can only do the work now because I truly believe that I'm worth it, and today I'm so grateful for my life, and I want to preserve and protect it. It is my personal mission to share with others of all ages people who are children, that are fans, people that don't know my music at all, but hopefully my speech today can have some impact.",57.14,55-60
23,Demi_Lovato,23_9,"It is my mission to share this with the world and to let them know there is life on the other side of those dark times that seem so hopeless and helpless. I want to show the world there is life, surprising, wonderful, and unexpected life after diagnosis. I'm proud to say that I'm living proof that someone can live, love, and thrive with bipolar disorder if they get connected, with professional resources, and accept support as soon as possible. That's why I'm participating in the mental health listening and engagement tour, getting to meet people like you and learning more about the issues that face the mental health community, us. I hope to do my part to make things a little easier for others and to reduce the shame associated with mental illness.",64.29,60-65
23,Demi_Lovato,23_10,"I want to do what I can to make things better for others by becoming the strongest and most informed mental health advocate that I can be. Today we have a chance to make history with NAMI, an organization that has been the forefront of advancing mental health in this country for decades. We've seen increased attention to our country's broken mental health system over the past few years, but we've seen very little action. Today our message is very clear; it is time for Congress to act for mental health by supporting the passage of a comprehensive mental health bill this year. I understand that the details around comprehensive meant at that tall health care are complex.",71.43,70-75
23,Demi_Lovato,23_11,"I'm not a policy expert, in any way, shape, or form. I do know the basics of comprehensive care make good sense, common sense. Comprehensive care means that as a nation, we step up our efforts to prevent suicide, which is currently the second leading cause of death for young adults in the United States. Comprehensive care means that if a man with mental illness gets diabetes or cancer, his doctors work together to determine what is the best approach for his mind and victims. Comprehensive care also means that when a woman leaves as a psychiatric hospital, there's a process in place to make sure she gets the care that she needs, so she didn't end up back in jail, hospitals, or on the streets, or worst of all, even dead.",78.57,75-80
23,Demi_Lovato,23_12,"At the heart of it, comprehensive care means that our mental health systems reach people early, and far more often, fewer people fall through the cracks and suffer alone. I'm so proud to be here with you today; together, as mental health advocates, we can make our voices heard. Our shared message is simple, like you said, keep it simple. Support passage of a comprehensive mental health bill this year. So go out there and make today count.",85.71,85-90
23,Demi_Lovato,23_13,"Together we will make a difference as we act for mental health. Don't forget to tweet and post throughout the day. We all know that gets the word going. I'm about to right now, you know, not sitting on an important panel.

I used to go in — I used to go fishing in Vancouver, my home, with my Dad until, just a few years ago, we found the fish full of cancers. And now we hear of animals and plants going extinct every day, vanishing forever. In my life, I have dreamt of seeing the great herds of wild animals, jungles, and rainforests full of birds and butterflies, but now I wonder if they will even exist for my children to see.

"" If a child on the streets who has nothing is willing to share, why are we who have everything still so greedy?

At school, even in kindergarten, you teach us how to behave in the world. You teach us to not to fight with others, to work things out, to respect others, to clean up our mess, not to hurt other creatures, to share, not be greedy.

I came over here with absolutely nothing. It was his help. I had $20 in the pocket and some sweaty clothes in the gym bag.",40.48,40-45
25,Arnold_Schwarzenegger,25_18,"But, let me tell you I had this one little apartment and on Thanksgiving, the bodybuilders from Gold's Gym came to my apartment and they brought me pillows, dishes, silverware, all of those things I didn't have. And even a black and white TV and the transistor radio, which I still have today on the end table next to my bed. The generosity that I saw. The amount of help that I got when I came to America was absolutely extraordinary, saw firsthand how generous the American people are. And then in Gold's Gym, there was a magical place with all of the champions, Mr. Americas, Mr. World, Mr. Universe, everyone was training, powerlifters, Olympic champions and so on.",42.86,40-45
25,Arnold_Schwarzenegger,25_19,"And they helped me change from an amateur champion to a professional champion. And after that, I won champion after championship, Seven times Mr. Olympia. You heard it all. And became the greatest bodybuilder of all times according to the bodybuilding magazine in 1975. Now this is just — with all of the help, I would not have made any of that by myself.",45.24,45-50
25,Arnold_Schwarzenegger,25_20,"So, this is why I don't believe in the self‑made man and even when it comes to show business, it was the same thing. I mean — you read the stories that Schwarzenegger decided from one day to the next to retire from bodybuilding and to go and become an actor. And in no time, he did Conan the Barbarian and Terminator and Commander and so on. Well, it is true, but it is only half of the story because the reality of it is without a lot of help I wouldn't have made it. First of all, it would have been fun to make it that easy and to be that easy, but it was very, very difficult to get into the movies.",47.62,45-50
25,Arnold_Schwarzenegger,25_21,"Very difficult. And only because I had help, I could get in because in the beginning every agent, every manager, every studio executive said, you will never become a leading man. Look at your body. You look like a monster. I was upset about that because I trained so hard and for so long and all of a sudden they call me monsters, but the bottom line is, they said, 'This is the 70's.",50.0,50-55
25,Arnold_Schwarzenegger,25_22,"Twenty years they did Hercules. Movies today, the little guys are in; Dustin Hoffman, Al Pacino, Woody Allen. Those are the sex symbols of the 70's. Don't you understand it?' I said, 'Oh, my God.",52.38,50-55
25,Arnold_Schwarzenegger,25_23,"Who are they?' But they even belittled me with my accent. They said, 'Look, the way you talk. I have to be very honest. I don't want to offend you, but you give me the creeps with your accent, with that German accent.",54.76,50-55
25,Arnold_Schwarzenegger,25_24,"It's scary.' They said, 'Maybe we can get you a job in Hogan's Heroes, in that TV show, to play a Nazi officer. And plus your name, Schwarzen, Schmitzl, or whatever it is, I can see that already up there on billboard, and people running in because of the name.' The bottom line is, it was very, very difficult but only because I decided not to listen to the nay‑sayers and because I decided to work as hard as I did in bodybuilding, to take acting lessons, to take voice lessons, English lessons, speech lessons and accent removal lessons. Now, I know you are going to say: 'Get your money back, Arnold.'",57.14,55-60
25,Arnold_Schwarzenegger,25_25,"But the bottom line is I ran around, 'The fine wine grows on a vine,' because the Germans always had difficulties with the F, W, and the V. The fine wine grows on a vine. And then, 'The sink is made out of zinc' and all those kinds of things. So, I did this thousands of time and eventually it worked. I started getting little parts and then I started getting bigger parts, and then eventually, even though it was very difficult, it was Dino De Laurentiis and Ed Pressman that came to me with Conan the Barbarian. And if they wouldn't have helped me to get that part, I would not have broken through and become a leading man.",59.52,55-60
25,Arnold_Schwarzenegger,25_26,"This movie came out — they spent $20 million, which in today's terms is around $200 million on that movie. It was number 1 in the box office. That was, for me, the big breakthrough. And at the press conference, the director even said, if we wouldn't have Schwarzenegger, we would have to build one because I was the only one that could act and had a body like that for Conan the Barbarian. And then, of course, there was James Cameron that directed Terminator.",61.9,60-65
25,Arnold_Schwarzenegger,25_27,"When Terminator came out, James Cameron said, the reason why Terminator worked is because Schwarzenegger talks like a machine. Now, I don't know if I should take this as a compliment or what, but the bottom line is, it was the two things that the studio executives said would be big liability, became big, big assets and my career took off. And this is why I always say thank you to the people that helped me along the way and not ever think that I'm a self‑made man because, not only was the producer and directors that are helpful, and the studio executives are helpful, but every person that works in a movie. As a matter of fact, when we have a wrap party, which is the party at the end of the movie, I always make sure every person gets invited to that wrap party, to say thank you to them at the wrap party. And go to the microphone and you say thank you to the cameraman because without him, I wouldn't look as great on the screen; to the makeup person; to the visual effects person; to the stunt people; the stunt coordinator; the cable pullers; craft services; and the list goes on and on and on.",64.29,60-65
25,Arnold_Schwarzenegger,25_28,"There's 280 people that work in a movie that make you look great on that screen so how can I say I'm a self‑made man? So, this is why it is important for all of us to recognize and this is why I tell you, on every step of the way I had help. Even when I ran for governor, people say, 'One day he decided to run for governor and to take over the sixth largest economy in the world.' No, this is not the way it was.",66.67,65-70
25,Arnold_Schwarzenegger,25_29,"Yes, I took over and yes, I won the governorship, but if it wouldn't have been for Jay Leno, who hosted the tonight show, who I called a week before and I said, 'I want to announce my candidacy on your show, on the Tonight Show because I want to sell myself as an outsider because the people in California are sick and tired of the typical politician.' So, he said to me, and he was a great friend, he said 'Yes. I'm going to help you with you that.' And I announced, without anyone knowing, on August 6th, on the Tonight Show, my candidacy. And he even organized 100 journalists from politics to sit in the back when I announced my candidacy.",69.05,65-70
25,Arnold_Schwarzenegger,25_30,"So, this is the kind of help I got. Then, of course, I didn't even have a team yet. People came out of nowhere and just started helping organizing the campaign, and with fundraising, and with communication, and with all of those things. And I became, two months later, the governor of the state of California, but it took a lot of help. And I have to say that it is important to acknowledge that because people make it always sound that you did all this yourself.",71.43,70-75
25,Arnold_Schwarzenegger,25_31,"I didn't. I did it with a lot of help. Yes, I was determined. Yes, I never listened to the nay‑sayers. Yes, I had a great vision.",73.81,70-75
25,Arnold_Schwarzenegger,25_32,"Yes, I had the fire in the belly and all of those things, but I didn't do it without the help. And even when you then say, Schwarzenegger did the most unbelievable environmental laws in California, well guess how laws are done? It took the legislators — 120 legislators to negotiate for weeks and months at a time, and then to send down legislation and then you sign that. So you need help too. I had a lot of help along the way and this is why it is so important for all of you to recognize that.",76.19,75-80
25,Arnold_Schwarzenegger,25_33,"And the biggest help, of course, was from America. If I wouldn't have come to the United States, if I would have come to any other country, I would not have had the success. I mean, America has proven not only to the be the land of opportunity image‑wise, but America has proven to be the greatest country in the world. Anyone can make it! This is why I always tell people, none of my careers would have happened if it wouldn't have been for the United States of America.",78.57,75-80
25,Arnold_Schwarzenegger,25_34,"I could have gone to the Middle East. Do you think I would stand here today? I could have gone to Africa. Do you think I would stand here today Or to Australia or to Asia, to any other country in Europe, it makes no difference. This place has given me the opportunity, step after step, all the way through all my three careers and the millions and millions of dollars I've made all because of America.",80.95,80-85
25,Arnold_Schwarzenegger,25_35,"So, thank you, America, for the great thing that you're doing for immigrants that come over here. And the reason why I want you to understand that is because as soon as you understand that you are here because of a lot of help, then you also understand that now is time to help others. That's what this is all about. You got to help others. Don't just think about yourself.",83.33,80-85
25,Arnold_Schwarzenegger,25_36,"Help others. As my father‑in‑law, sergeant Shriver said, at Yale university commencement speech, just like I'm speaking right now here, except I speak to a better university, but he said — Sergeant Shriver said — you know he was the guy that created the Peace Corps, the Job Corps, Legal Aid to the poor and an extraordinarily human being under the Johnson and Kennedy administration. So, he said to those students, he said, 'Tear down this mirror. Tear down this mirror that makes you always look at yourself and you will be able to look beyond this mirror and see the millions of people that need your help.' And let me tell you something, when I heard that, it all made sense to me, that we have to go out and help.",85.71,85-90
25,Arnold_Schwarzenegger,25_37,"And this is why I got involved in special Olympics, to be the international coach of special Olympics, and then eventually became the chairman of the president's council on physical fitness and sports. I was appointed by President Bush, my favorite Houstonian and — I should not say the only one, but Barbara. I should add Barbara because I see them later on. I don't want to leave out Barbara here because otherwise, she gets really mad. Yeah, so anyway,",88.1,85-90
25,Arnold_Schwarzenegger,25_38,"So both of them. And then drive through around all 50 states to promote health and fitness and then eventually started after‑school programs and now we are in 40 different — 48 different cities providing after‑school programs for over 100,000 kids and all this. So, i mean it is — to me, it was very important to give back and also to go — every time I travel around the world, to go military bases and to visit our brave men and women that save us, that protect us, to say, thank you, thank you, thank you to them, anywhere in the world that I travel. So it is important to recognize that. So all I'm saying is, it is my challenge to you today to go ahead and to celebrate your accomplishment.",90.48,90-95
25,Arnold_Schwarzenegger,25_39,"You should. This commencement is a great success and each of you earned your diplomas, but at some point, take a break from the celebration, away from the Instagrams and snapchats, and think about all of the people that help you. Make sure to go and to recognize President Khator and to say thank you to her for the great work that she has done. Say thank you to the deans of this university that are responsible to make this university so great. Say thank you to the professors and associate professors, everyone that taught you and everyone that's responsible for you to be here today, and go to your parents and give them a big, big hug and tell them that you love them and thank you for everything that you have done to get me here today.",92.86,90-95
25,Arnold_Schwarzenegger,25_40,"do that, And give something back to your community and to your state and to this country because remember, in the end, we are not going to be remembered for how much we made but for how much we have given. Make sure that it is not about me. That it is about 'we.' Turn the 'me' into 'we,' and I guarantee you that you can change the world. Thank you very much all of you cougars.",95.24,95-100
25,Arnold_Schwarzenegger,25_41,Thank you.,97.62,95-100
26,Steven_Spielberg,26_0,"Thank you, thank you, President Faust, and Paul Choi, thank you so much. It's an honor and a thrill to address this group of distinguished alumni and supportive friends and kvelling parents. We've all gathered to share in the joy of this day, so please join me in congratulating Harvard's Class of 2016. I can remember my own college graduation, which is easy, since it was only 14 years ago. How many of you took 37 years to graduate?",0.0,0-5
26,Steven_Spielberg,26_1,"Because, like most of you, I began college in my teens, but sophomore year, I was offered my dream job at Universal Studios, so I dropped out. I told my parents if my movie career didn't go well, I'd re-enroll. It went all right. But eventually, I returned for one big reason. Most people go to college for an education, and some go for their parents, but I went for my kids.",3.12,0-5
26,Steven_Spielberg,26_2,"I'm the father of seven, and I kept insisting on the importance of going to college, but I hadn't walked the walk. So, in my fifties, I re-enrolled at Cal State — Long Beach, and I earned my degree. I just have to add: It helped that they gave me course credit in paleontology for the work I did on Jurassic Park. That's three units for Jurassic Park, thank you. Well I left college because I knew exactly what I wanted to do, and some of you know, too — but some of you don't.",6.25,5-10
26,Steven_Spielberg,26_3,"Or maybe you thought you knew but are now questioning that choice. Maybe you're sitting there trying to figure out how to tell your parents that you want to be a doctor and not a comedy writer. Well, what you choose to do next is what we call in the movies the 'character-defining moment.' Now, these are moments you're very familiar with, like in the last Star Wars: The Force Awakens, when Rey realizes the force is with her. Or Indiana Jones choosing mission over fear by jumping over a pile of snakes.",9.38,5-10
26,Steven_Spielberg,26_4,"Now in a two-hour movie, you get a handful of character-defining moments, but in real life, you face them every day. Life is one strong, long string of character-defining moments. And I was lucky that at 18 I knew what I exactly wanted to do. But I didn't know who I was. How could I?",12.5,10-15
26,Steven_Spielberg,26_5,"And how could any of us? Because for the first 25 years of our lives, we are trained to listen to voices that are not our own. Parents and professors fill our heads with wisdom and information, and then employers and mentors take their place and explain how this world really works. And usually these voices of authority make sense, but sometimes, doubt starts to creep into our heads and into our hearts. And even when we think, 'that's not quite how I see the world,' it's kind of easier to just to nod in agreement and go along, and for a while, I let that going along define my character.",15.62,15-20
26,Steven_Spielberg,26_6,"Because I was repressing my own point of view, because like in that Nilsson song, 'Everybody was talkin' at me, so I couldn't hear the echoes of my mind.' And at first, the internal voice I needed to listen to was hardly audible, and it was hardly noticeable — kind of like me in high school. But then I started paying more attention, and my intuition kicked in. And I want to be clear that your intuition is different from your conscience. They work in tandem, but here's the distinction: Your conscience shouts, 'here's what you should do,' while your intuition whispers, 'here's what you could do.'",18.75,15-20
26,Steven_Spielberg,26_7,"Listen to that voice that tells you what you could do. Nothing will define your character more than that. Because once I turned to my intuition, and I tuned into it, certain projects began to pull me into them, and others, I turned away from. Related: Sheryl Sandberg Commencement Speech, University of California at Berkeley, May 2016 (Transcript) And up until the 1980s, my movies were mostly, I guess what you could call 'escapist.'",21.88,20-25
26,Steven_Spielberg,26_8,"And I don't dismiss any of these movies — not even 1941. Not even that one. And many of these early films reflected the values that I cared deeply about, and I still do. But I was in a celluloid bubble, because I'd cut my education short, my worldview was limited to what I could dream up in my head, not what the world could teach me. But then I directed The Color Purple.",25.0,25-30
26,Steven_Spielberg,26_9,"And this one film opened my eyes to experiences that I never could have imagined, and yet were all too real. This story was filled with deep pain and deeper truths, like when Shug Avery says, 'Everything wants to be loved.' My gut, which was my intuition, told me that more people needed to meet these characters and experience these truths. And while making that film, I realized that a movie could also be a mission. I hope all of you find that sense of mission.",28.12,25-30
26,Steven_Spielberg,26_10,Don't turn away from what's painful. Examine it. Challenge it. My job is to create a world that lasts two hours. Your job is to create a world that lasts forever.,31.25,30-35
26,Steven_Spielberg,26_11,"You are the future innovators, motivators, leaders and caretakers. And the way you create a better future is by studying the past. Jurassic Park writer Michael Crichton, who graduated from both this college and this medical school, liked to quote a favorite professor of his who said that if you didn't know history, you didn't know anything. You were a leaf that didn't know it was part of a tree. So history majors: Good choice, you're in great shape…Not in the job market, but culturally.",34.38,30-35
26,Steven_Spielberg,26_12,"The rest of us have to make a little effort. Social media that we're inundated and swarmed with is about the here and now. But I've been fighting and fighting inside my own family to get all my kids to look behind them, to look at what already has happened. Because to understand who they are is to understand who were were, and who their grandparents were, and then, what this country was like when they emigrated here. We are a nation of immigrants — at least for now.",37.5,35-40
26,Steven_Spielberg,26_13,"So to me, this means we all have to tell our own stories. We have so many stories to tell. Talk to your parents and your grandparents, if you can, and ask them about their stories. And I promise you, like I have promised my kids, you will not be bored. And that's why I so often make movies based on real-life events.",40.62,40-45
26,Steven_Spielberg,26_14,"I look to history not to be didactic, 'cause that's just a bonus, but I look because the past is filled with the greatest stories that have ever been told. Heroes and villains are not literary constructs, but they're at the heart of all history. And again, this is why it's so important to listen to your internal whisper. It's the same one that compelled Abraham Lincoln and Oskar Schindler to make the correct moral choices. In your defining moments, do not let your morals be swayed by convenience or expediency.",43.75,40-45
26,Steven_Spielberg,26_15,"Sticking to your character requires a lot of courage. And to be courageous, you're going to need a lot of support. And if you're lucky, you have parents like mine. I consider my mom my lucky charm. And when I was 12 years old, my father handed me a movie camera, the tool that allowed me to make sense of this world.",46.88,45-50
26,Steven_Spielberg,26_16,"And I am so grateful to him for that. And I am grateful that he's here at Harvard, sitting right down there. My dad is 99 years old, which means he's only one year younger than Widener Library. But unlike Widener, he's had zero cosmetic work. And dad, there's a lady behind you, also 99, and I'll introduce you after this is over, okay?",50.0,50-55
26,Steven_Spielberg,26_17,"But look, if your family's not always available, there's backup. Near the end of It's a Wonderful Life — you remember that movie, It's a Wonderful Life? Clarence the Angel inscribes a book with this: ""No man is a failure who has friends."" And I hope you hang on to the friendships you've made here at Harvard. And among your friends, I hope you find someone you want to share your life with.",53.12,50-55
26,Steven_Spielberg,26_18,"I imagine some of you in this yard may be a tad cynical, but I want to be unapologetically sentimental. I spoke about the importance of intuition and how there's no greater voice to follow. That is, until you meet the love of your life. And this is what happened when I met and married Kate, and that became the greatest character-defining moment of my life. Love, support, courage, intuition.",56.25,55-60
26,Steven_Spielberg,26_19,"All of these things are in your hero's quiver, but still, a hero needs one more thing: A hero needs a villain to vanquish. And you're all in luck. This world is full of monsters. And there's racism, homophobia, ethnic hatred, class hatred, there's political hatred, and there's religious hatred. As a kid, I was bullied — for being Jewish.",59.38,55-60
26,Steven_Spielberg,26_20,"This was upsetting, but compared to what my parents and grandparents had faced, it felt tame. Because we truly believed that anti-Semitism was fading. And we were wrong. Over the last two years, nearly 20,000 Jews have left Europe to find higher ground. And earlier this year, I was at the Israeli embassy when President Obama stated the sad truth.",62.5,60-65
26,Steven_Spielberg,26_21,"He said: 'We must confront the reality that around the world, anti-Semitism is on the rise. We cannot deny it.' My own desire to confront that reality compelled me to start, in 1994, the Shoah Foundation. And since then, we've spoken to over 53,000 Holocaust survivors and witnesses in 63 countries and taken all their video testimonies. And we're now gathering testimonies from genocides in Rwanda, Cambodia, Armenia and Nanking.",65.62,65-70
26,Steven_Spielberg,26_22,"Because we must never forget that the inconceivable doesn't happen — it happens frequently. Atrocities are happening right now. And so we wonder not just, 'When will this hatred end?' but, 'How did it begin?' Now, I don't have to tell a crowd of Red Sox fans that we are wired for tribalism.",68.75,65-70
26,Steven_Spielberg,26_23,"But beyond rooting for the home team, tribalism has a much darker side. Instinctively and maybe even genetically, we divide the world into 'us' and 'them.' So the burning question must be: How do all of us together find the 'we?' How do we do that? There's still so much work to be done, and sometimes I feel the work hasn't even begun.",71.88,70-75
26,Steven_Spielberg,26_24,"And it's not just anti-Semitism that's surging — Islamophobia's on the rise, too. Because there's no difference between anyone who is discriminated against, whether it's the Muslims, or the Jews, or minorities on the border states, or the LGBT community — it is all big one hate. And to me, and, I think, to all of you, the only answer to more hate is more humanity. We gotta repair — we have to replace fear with curiosity. 'Us' and 'them' — we'll find the 'we' by connecting with each other.",75.0,75-80
26,Steven_Spielberg,26_25,"And by believing that we're members of the same tribe. And by feeling empathy for every soul — even Yalies. My son graduated from Yale, thank you … But make sure this empathy isn't just something that you feel. Make it something you act upon. That means vote.",78.12,75-80
26,Steven_Spielberg,26_26,"Peaceably protest. Speak up for those who can't and speak up for those who may be shouting but aren't being hard. Let your conscience shout as loud as it wants if you're using it in the service of others. And as an example of action in service of others, you need to look no further than this Hollywood-worthy backdrop of Memorial Church. Its south wall bears the names of Harvard alumni — like President Faust has already mentioned — students and faculty members, who gave their lives in World War II.",81.25,80-85
26,Steven_Spielberg,26_27,"All told, 697 souls, who once tread the ground where stand now, were lost. And at a service in this church in late 1945, Harvard President James Conant — which President Faust also mentioned — honored the brave and called upon the community to 'reflect the radiance of their deeds.' Seventy years later, this message still holds true. Because their sacrifice is not a debt that can be repaid in a single generation. It must be repaid with every generation.",84.38,80-85
26,Steven_Spielberg,26_28,"Just as we must never forget the atrocities, we must never forget those who fought for freedom. So as you leave this college and head out into the world, continue please to 'reflect the radiance of their deeds,' or as Captain Miller in Saving Private Ryan would say, ""Earn this."" And please stay connected. Please never lose eye contact. This may not be a lesson you want to hear from a person who creates media, but we are spending more time looking down at our devices than we are looking in each other's eyes.",87.5,85-90
26,Steven_Spielberg,26_29,"So, forgive me, but let's start right now. Everyone here, please find someone's eyes to look into. Students, and alumni and you too, President Faust, all of you, turn to someone you don't know or don't know very well. They may be standing behind you, or a couple of rows ahead. Just let your eyes meet.",90.62,90-95
26,Steven_Spielberg,26_30,"That's it. That emotion you're feeling is our shared humanity mixed in with a little social discomfort. But, if you remember nothing else from today, I hope you remember this moment of human connection. And I hope you all had a lot of that over the past four years. Because today you start down the path of becoming the generation on which the next generation stands.",93.75,90-95
26,Steven_Spielberg,26_31,"And I've imagined many possible futures in my films, but you will determine the actual future. And I hope that it's filled with justice and peace. And finally, I wish you all a true, Hollywood-style happy ending. I hope you outrun the T. rex, catch the criminal and for your parents' sake, maybe every now and then, just like E.T.: Go home. Thank you.",96.88,95-100
27,Glenn_Close,27_0,"When I graduated, 45 years ago, I was the first woman in my family to earn a college degree. My mother never finished high school. She got married at 18 and had her first child two years later. Neither of my grandmothers or great-grandmothers, went to college. In their society, at the time, it just wasn't done.",0.0,0-5
27,Glenn_Close,27_1,"My paternal grandmother, however, did run away from Texas and worked in a bank in order to put her sister through college. My two sisters never went to college. So being here today has an extra special significance for me. I just want to mention briefly why I happened to end up at William & Mary. I won't go into the complexities of the story, but suffice it to say that the first time I saw this campus was in the late 60's when I sprinted off the girls' bus, in my cheery travel uniform, as a member of a singing group for which I wrote songs and performed for five years after high school.",4.0,0-5
27,Glenn_Close,27_2,"The show was the offshoot of a cult-like group that my parents fell prey to when I was 7-years-old. Once off the bus, we enthusiastically set up our mics and speakers in the old Student Rec Center on Dog Street and proceeded to sing our hearts out for whatever students paused to listen. As I sang the simplistic songs and did the regimented choreography, I studied the students who were lounging on the furniture or leaning against the walls and there came a moment when I knew that I had to somehow leave the group and come get my education here. And you want to know why? It was because, almost to a person, they were looking at us like this … as if they were thinking — ""Really?""",8.0,5-10

Somehow, in spite of my ignorance, I sensed that on this campus, I would find kindred souls. So eventually, against their wishes, and with no encouragement, whatsoever, I left the group and, 49 years ago, I entered The College of William & Mary in Virginia, a 22-year-old clueless freshman, with an essentially empty toolbox and a passionate determination to get a liberal arts education and become an actress.",12.0,10-15

It doesn't come to me naturally. I had been raised to be a total believer, to not question.

It makes absolutely no sense to me that we don't talk about it like any other chronic illness. Starting the conversation is the first step.

Wilson, that one of the core reasons we have been so successful as a species is that we evolved the capacity to empathize. That means that the tribes who espoused empathy were more successful at survival than the ones who didn't. In order for the community, the tribe, to survive and thrive, we humans had to evolve the ability to register the emotions, the plight, the fears and the needs of other members of our tribe and to respond to them with empathy. We die without connection.",72.0,70-75

Yet, women and children make up the vast majority of all casualties in armed conflict today. Laws prohibiting attacks on schools and hospitals are routinely breached, for instance, in Syria. Laws prohibiting the denial of aid relief to civilians are repeatedly ignored, whether in Rakhine State or in Myanmar today, or in Yemen, where millions of people are facing death from starvation. And despite being prohibited by law, sexual violence continues to be employed as a tactic of war in 19 countries.",7.14,5-10
29,Angelina_Jolie,29_2,"It includes mass rape, gang rape, sexual slavery, and rape as a form of torture, ethnic cleansing, and terrorism. It has been 68 years since the Geneva Convention Fourth Protocol, which said women shall be especially protected against any attack on their honor, in particular against rape, enforced prostitution, or any form of indecent assault. It has been 21 years since the UN first promised to address sexual abuse by UN peacekeepers and to increase the number of women deployed in operations. Yet, the exploitation of defenseless civilians still takes place, and still less than 4 percent of all peacekeepers are women. It has been 19 years since the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court stating that mass atrocities, including rape and sexual slavery, would not go unpunished.",14.29,10-15
29,Angelina_Jolie,29_3,"And yet, justice for survivors of rape is still the exception. It has been 17 years since the UN Security Council Resolution 1325 called for an end to the exclusion of women from peace negotiations, for special protection for women and girls against sexual violence, and for an end to impunity. So we have to ask, how is it, after all these years, all these laws, and all these resolutions, and all the horrors endured, women still have to ask for this most basic of all entitlements, the right to a life free from violence. Sexual violence is everywhere. In the industry where I work, in businesses, in universities, in policies, politicians, military across the world, it affects men as well as women.",21.43,20-25
29,Angelina_Jolie,29_4,"However, it is recognized by the UN as one of the prime reasons why women remain in a subordinate position in relation to men in parts of the world, and as a critical obstacle to achieving women's equality and our full human rights. Ending gender-based violence is therefore a vital issue of social justice in all nations, and confronting its use in its most extreme form as a weapon of war is essential for future peace and security. I want to address three myths that I believe go to the heart of why these crimes still occur, and what we have to overcome together. The first myth is that this behavior is sexual. All too often, these kinds of crimes against women are laughed off and depicted as a minor offense by someone who cannot control themselves, as an illness or some kind of exaggerated sexual need.",28.57,25-30
29,Angelina_Jolie,29_5,"A man who mistreats women is abusive. Only last week, a trial opened in the Democratic Republic of Congo for 46 alleged cases of rape of children by militia fighters who had been told that the blood of virgins would grant them supernatural protection. Some of the victims were 18 months old. According to the UN, almost every female Rohingya refugee in the camps in Bangladesh is either a survivor of sexual violence or a witness to multiple instances of sexual assault, rape, or gang rape. MSF said that half of the patients it has treated for rape are under 18 years old, and one was just 9 years old.",35.71,35-40
29,Angelina_Jolie,29_6,"This is rape and assault designed to torture, to terrorize, and to force people to flee. It has nothing to do with sex. It has everything to do with abuse of power. It is criminal behavior. The second myth is that even when conflict-related sexual violence is clearly understood as a crime, it is treated as a lesser crime, an inevitable aspect of the breakdown of social order, not a central issue for peace negotiations or agreements, and not grave enough to mount prosecutions and imprison those responsible.",42.86,40-45
29,Angelina_Jolie,29_7,But sexual violence is a weapon used to deliberate effect to achieve military or political objectives. It is cheaper than a bullet. It has long-lasting consequences that unfold with sickening predictability. And that is what makes it so cruelly effective. I would like to ask everyone here to take a moment to consider the following scenario.,50.0,50-55
29,Angelina_Jolie,29_8,"Imagine your hometown, the street where you live, a conflict has broken out in your country. One night, trucks roll in, and your street is surrounded and blocked off. Men with guns pour out of those trucks and start breaking down doors. They go from house to house in your street, and in the course of one night, they rape every woman or girl they find, and they do so in front of their families. Now think how you and your family would be affected that night, that day, for the months and years to come, that impact on all of you, the emotional pain and trauma, the stigma, the shame, the physical and mental illness, how broken you would feel that you were unable to stop this from happening to your family members, and how bitter you would feel at being told months or years later that you have to move on and forget because there is now a peace agreement and justice for your families is less important.",57.14,55-60
29,Angelina_Jolie,29_9,"This is the reality for millions of families today. It is happening today, day in, day out, and more often than not, we know about it. It's on our television screens and our newspapers. Why then, why then does nothing really change? And this brings me to my third myth, which is that even if we accept that sexual violence has nothing to do with sex, and understand that it is a crime, that it is used as a weapon, with many people, they will still believe that it's just simply not possible, that's how it goes.",64.29,60-65
29,Angelina_Jolie,29_10,"How could we possibly prevent sexual violence in the extreme conditions of war? It is hard, yes, but it is not impossible. We have the laws, the institutions, the expertise in gathering evidence. We are able to identify perpetrators and those responsible. What is missing?",71.43,70-75
29,Angelina_Jolie,29_11,"The political will. This brings me to the role of the military. There is nothing worse than when someone in uniform is harming the very civilians they are sent to protect. Now, I'd like to believe that no one is angrier than you when one of your own betrays their uniform and your values in that way. In the last few years, I have seen a dramatic change in the willingness of military leaders to address the taboos around these issues and to take action.",78.57,75-80
29,Angelina_Jolie,29_12,"In Kenya earlier this year, I met peacekeepers from around the world receiving training, many of them for the first time, in how to identify and respond to sexual violence and to interact appropriately with survivors on UN peacekeeping missions. Canada, the UK, and Bangladesh have announced today the Senior Military Chiefs Network, promising to work with other senior military officers to increase the number of women in their militaries, to change training to include gender and women peace and security, to deploy more women in operational roles, and to appoint full-time gender advisors. And many of the countries represented at this conference have also made new and very important pledges. So I thank them, and I thank you for these commitments. I hope they will be just the beginning.",85.71,85-90

And I am here, determined to do anything I can to work alongside all of you. Thank you for all you've done today. Thank you for your efforts. And I look forward to our work.",92.86,90-95
30,JD_Vance,30_0,"The kind introduction, and I want to start by thanking President Macron for hosting the event and of course the lovely dinner last night. During the dinner, President Macron looked at me and asked if I would like to speak, and I said, Mr. President, I'm here for the good company and free wine, but I have to earn my keep today. And I of course want to thank Prime Minister Modi for being here, for co-hosting the summit, and for all of you for participating. I'm not here this morning to talk about AI safety, which was the title of the conference a couple of years ago. I'm here to talk about AI opportunity.",0.0,0-5
30,JD_Vance,30_1,"When conferences like this convene to discuss a cutting-edge technology, oftentimes I think our response is to be too self-conscious, too risk-averse. But never have I encountered a breakthrough in tech that so clearly calls us to do precisely the opposite. Now, our administration, the Trump administration, believes that AI will have countless revolutionary applications—in economic innovation, job creation, national security, healthcare, free expression, and beyond. And to restrict its development now will not only unfairly benefit incumbents in the space, it would mean paralyzing one of the most promising technologies we have seen in generations. Now, with that in mind, I'd like to make four main points today.",4.17,0-5
30,JD_Vance,30_2,"Number one, this administration will ensure that American AI technology continues to be the gold standard worldwide. And we are the partner of choice for others, foreign countries, and certainly businesses as they expand their own use of AI. Number two, we believe that excessive regulation of the AI sector could kill a transformative industry just as it's taking off. And we will make every effort to encourage pro-growth AI policies. And I like to see that deregulatory flavor making its way into a lot of the conversations at this conference.",8.33,5-10
30,JD_Vance,30_3,"Number three, we feel very strongly that AI must remain free from ideological bias. And that American AI will not be co-opted into a tool for authoritarian censorship. And finally, number four, the Trump administration will maintain a pro-worker growth path for AI so it can be a potent tool for job creation in the United States. And I appreciate Prime Minister Modi's point. AI, I really believe, will facilitate and make people more productive.",12.5,10-15
30,JD_Vance,30_4,"It is not going to replace human beings. It will never replace human beings. I think too many of the leaders in the AI industry, when they talk about this fear of replacing workers, really miss the point. AI, we believe, is going to make us more productive, more prosperous, and more free. The United States of America is the leader in AI, and our administration plans to keep it that way.",16.67,15-20
30,JD_Vance,30_5,"The US possesses all components across the full AI stack—including advanced semiconductor design, frontier algorithms, and of course transformational applications. Now, the computing power this stack requires is integral to advancing AI technology. And to safeguard America's advantage, the Trump administration will ensure that the most powerful AI systems are built in the US with American-designed and manufactured chips. Now, just because we're the leader doesn't mean we want to or need to go it alone. And let me be emphatic about this point.",20.83,20-25
30,JD_Vance,30_6,"America wants to partner with all of you. And we want to embark on the AI revolution before us with the spirit of openness and collaboration. But to create that kind of trust, we need international regulatory regimes that foster the creation of AI technology, rather than strangle it. And we need our European friends in particular to look to this new frontier with optimism rather than trepidation. Now, the development of cutting-edge AI in the US is no accident.",25.0,25-30
30,JD_Vance,30_7,"By preserving an open regulatory environment, we've encouraged American leaders to experiment and to make unparalleled R&D investments. Of the $700 billion, give or take, that's estimated to be spent on AI in 2028, over half of it will likely be invested in the United States of America. Now, this administration will not be the one to snuff out the startups and the grad students producing some of the most groundbreaking applications of artificial intelligence. Instead, our laws will keep big tech, little tech, and all other developers on a level playing field. Now, with the President's recent executive order on AI, we're developing an AI action plan that avoids an overly precautionary regulatory regime while ensuring that all Americans benefit from the technology and its transformative potential.",29.17,25-30
30,JD_Vance,30_8,"Now, we invite your countries to work with us and to follow that model if it makes sense for your nations. However, the Trump administration is troubled by reports that some foreign governments are considering tightening the screws on U.S. tech companies with international footprints. Now, America cannot and will not accept that. And we think it's a terrible mistake, not just for the United States of America, but for your own countries. Now, U.S. innovators of all sizes already know what it's like to deal with onerous international rules.",33.33,30-35
30,JD_Vance,30_9,"Many of our most productive tech companies are forced to deal with the EU's Digital Services Act and the massive regulations it created about taking down content and policing so-called misinformation. Of course, we want to ensure the internet is a safe place. But it is one thing to prevent a predator from preying on a child on the internet. And it is something quite different to prevent a grown man or woman from accessing an opinion that the government thinks is misinformation. Meanwhile, for smaller firms, navigating the GDPR means paying endless legal compliance costs or otherwise risking massive fines.",37.5,35-40
30,JD_Vance,30_10,"Now, for some, the easiest way to avoid the dilemma has been to simply block EU users in the first place. Is this really the future that we want, ladies and gentlemen? I think the answer for all of us should be no. Now, there's no issue we worry about more than regulation when it comes to energy. And again, I appreciated the comments of so many at the conference, because they recognize that we stand now at the frontier of an AI industry that is hungry for reliable power and high-quality semiconductors.",41.67,40-45
30,JD_Vance,30_11,"Yet too many of our friends are deindustrializing, on the one hand, and chasing reliable power out of their nations and off their grids with the other. The AI future is not going to be won by hand-wringing about safety. It will be won by building—from reliable power plants to the manufacturing facilities that can produce the chips of the future. Now, to put it on a personal level, what excites me most about AI is that it is grounded in the real and the physical economy. The success of the sector isn't just a matter of smart people sitting in front of a computer screen and coding.",45.83,45-50
30,JD_Vance,30_12,"It depends on those who work with their hands, even as robotics will change our factories. It will certainly make our healthcare providers better at treating diseases. But it will also depend on the data produced by those healthcare providers, by those doctors and nurses. I believe it will help us create and store new modes of power in the future. But right now, AI cannot take off unless the world builds the energy infrastructure to support it.",50.0,50-55
30,JD_Vance,30_13,"Now, it's my view that tech innovation over the last 20 years has often conjured images of smart people staring at computer screens, engineering in the world of bits. But the AI economy will primarily depend on and transform the world of atoms. Now, at this moment, we face the extraordinary prospect of a new industrial revolution—one on par with the invention of the steam engine or Bessemer steel. But it will never come to pass if over-regulation deters innovators from taking the risks necessary to advance the ball. Nor will it occur if we allow AI to become dominated by massive players looking to use the tech to censor or control users' thoughts.",54.17,50-55
30,JD_Vance,30_14,"And I'd ask you to step back a moment and ask yourself, who is most aggressively demanding that we, meaning political leaders gathered here today, do the most aggressive regulation? It is very often the people who already have an incumbent advantage in the market. And when a massive incumbent comes to us asking for safety regulations, we ought to ask whether that safety regulation is for the benefit of our people, or whether it's for the benefit of the incumbent. Now, over the last few years, we've watched as governments, businesses, and non-profit organizations have advanced unpopular, and I believe downright ahistorical, social agendas through AI. In the US, we had AI image generators trying to tell us that George Washington was black, or that America's doughboys in World War I were in fact women.",58.33,55-60
30,JD_Vance,30_15,"Now, we laugh at this now, and of course, it was ridiculous. But we have to remember the lessons from that moment. And what we take from it is that the Trump administration will ensure that AI systems developed in America are free from ideological bias. And they will never restrict our citizens' right to free speech. We can trust our people to think, to consume information, to develop their own ideas, and to debate with one another in the open marketplace of ideas.",62.5,60-65
30,JD_Vance,30_16,"Now, we've also watched as hostile foreign adversaries have weaponized AI software to rewrite history, surveil users, and censor speech. This is hardly new, of course. As they do with other tech, some authoritarian regimes have stolen and used AI to strengthen their military, intelligence, and surveillance capabilities. They capture foreign data and create propaganda to undermine other nations' national security. I want to be clear: this administration will block such efforts, full stop.",66.67,65-70
30,JD_Vance,30_17,"We will safeguard American AI and chip technologies from theft and misuse. We will work with our allies and partners to strengthen and extend these protections. And we will close pathways to adversaries attaining AI capabilities that threaten all of our people. And I would also remind our international friends here today that partnering with such regimes never pays off in the long term. From CCTV to 5G equipment, we're all familiar with cheap tech in the marketplace that's been heavily subsidized and exported by authoritarian regimes.",70.83,70-75
30,JD_Vance,30_18,"But as I know, and I think some of us in this room have learned from experience, partnering with them means chaining your nation to an authoritarian master. One that seeks to infiltrate, dig in, and seize your information infrastructure. Should a deal seem too good to be true, just remember the old adage that we learned in Silicon Valley: ""If you aren't paying for the product, you are the product."" Finally, this administration wants to be very clear about one last point: we will always center American workers in our AI policy. We refuse to view AI as a purely disruptive technology that will inevitably automate away our labor force.",75.0,75-80
30,JD_Vance,30_19,"We believe, and we will fight for policies that ensure, AI makes our workers more productive. And we expect that they will reap the rewards—with higher wages, better benefits, and safer, more prosperous communities. From law to medicine, manufacturing, the most immediate applications of AI almost all involve supplementing, not replacing, the work being done by Americans. Combined with this administration's worker-first approach to immigration, we believe that a U.S. labor force, prepared to use AI to its fullest extent, will instead attract the attention of businesses that have offshored some of these roles. To accomplish this, the administration will make sure that America has the best-trained workforce in the world.",79.17,75-80
30,JD_Vance,30_20,"Our schools will teach students how to manage, how to supervise, and how to interact with AI-enabled tools. As they become more and more a part of our everyday lives, AI will create new jobs and industries. Our government, businesses, and labor organizations have an obligation to work together to empower workers, not just in the U.S., but all over the world. To that end, for all major AI policy decisions coming from the federal government, the Trump administration will guarantee American workers a seat at the table. And we're very proud of that.",83.33,80-85
30,JD_Vance,30_21,"Now, I've taken up enough of your time, so I'd like to close with just a quick story. This is a beautiful country, President Macron, and I know that you're proud of it, and should be. Yesterday, as I was touring Les Invalides with General Gravette and my three kids, he was kind enough to show me the sword that belonged to America's dearest international friend—from our own revolution, the Marquis de Lafayette. He let me hold the sword, but of course, he made me put on the white gloves beforehand. And it got me thinking about this country, France, and of course, my own country.",87.5,85-90
30,JD_Vance,30_22,"And of the beautiful civilization that we have built together with weapons like that saber. Weapons that are dangerous in the wrong hands, but are incredible tools for liberty and prosperity in the right hands. I couldn't help but think of the conference today. If we choose the wrong approach on other things that could be conceived as dangerous, things like AI—if we hold ourselves back—it will alter not only our GDP or the stock market, but the very future of the project that Lafayette and the American founders set out to create. Now, this doesn't mean, of course, that all concerns about safety go out the window.",91.67,90-95
30,JD_Vance,30_23,"But focus matters. And we must focus now on the opportunity to catch lightning in a bottle, unleash our most brilliant innovators, and use AI to improve the well-being of our nations and their peoples. With great confidence, I can say it is an opportunity that the Trump administration will not squander. And we hope everyone convened here today feels exactly the same. Thank you, and God bless you all.",95.83,95-100
31,Emotional Eulogy for His Father,31_0,"""I once heard it said of man that the idea is to die young, as late as possible. At age 85, a favorite pastime of George H.W. Bush was firing up his boat, the Fidelity, and opening up the three 300-horsepower engines to fly — joyfully fly — across the Atlantic with the Secret Service boats straining to keep up. At age 90, George H.W. Bush parachuted out of an aircraft and landed on the grounds of St. Ann's by the Sea in Kennebunkport, Maine, the church where his mom was married and where he worshiped often. Mother liked to say he chose the location just in case the chute didn't open. In his 90s, he took great delight when his closest pal, James A. Baker, smuggled a bottle of Grey Goose vodka into his hospital room.",0.0,0-5
31,Emotional Eulogy for His Father,31_1,"Apparently, it paired well with the steak Baker had delivered from Morton's. To his very last days, Dad's life was instructive. As he aged, he taught us how to grow with dignity, humor and kindness, and when the good Lord finally called, how to meet Him with courage and with the joy of the promise of what lies ahead. One reason Dad knew how to die young is that he almost did it, twice. When he was a teenager, a staph infection nearly took his life.",4.55,0-5
31,Emotional Eulogy for His Father,31_2,"A few years later, he was alone in the Pacific on a life raft, praying that his rescuers would find him before the enemy did. God answered those prayers. It turned out He had other plans for George H.W. Bush. For Dad's part, I think those brushes with death made him cherish the gift of life, and he vowed to live every day to the fullest. Dad was always busy, a man in constant motion, but never too busy to share his love of life with those around him.",9.09,5-10
31,Emotional Eulogy for His Father,31_3,"He taught us to love the outdoors. He loved watching dogs flush a covey. He loved landing the elusive striper. And once confined to a wheelchair, he seemed happiest sitting in his favorite perch on the back porch at Walker's Point, contemplating the majesty of the Atlantic. The horizons he saw were bright and hopeful.",13.64,10-15
31,Emotional Eulogy for His Father,31_4,"He was a genuinely optimistic man, and that optimism guided his children and made each of us believe that anything was possible. He continually broadened his horizons with daring decisions. He was a patriot. After high school, he put college on hold and became a Navy fighter pilot as World War II broke out. Like many of his generation, he never talked about his service until his time as a public figure forced his hand.",18.18,15-20
31,Emotional Eulogy for His Father,31_5,"We learned of the attack on Chichi Jima, the mission completed, the shoot-down. We learned of the death of his crew mates, whom he thought about throughout his entire life. And we learned of the rescue. And then another audacious decision: He moved his young family from the comforts of the East Coast to Odessa, Texas. He and Mom adjusted to their arid surroundings quickly.",22.73,20-25
31,Emotional Eulogy for His Father,31_6,"He was a tolerant man. After all, he was kind and neighborly to the women with whom he, Mom and I shared a bathroom in our small duplex, even after he learned their profession: ladies of the night. Dad could relate to people from all walks of life. He was an empathetic man. He valued character over pedigree.",27.27,25-30
31,Emotional Eulogy for His Father,31_7,"And he was no cynic. He looked for the good in each person, and he usually found it. Dad taught us that public service is noble and necessary, that one can serve with integrity and hold true to the important values like faith and family. He strongly believed that it was important to give back to the community and country in which one lived. He recognized that serving others enriched the giver's soul.",31.82,30-35
31,Emotional Eulogy for His Father,31_8,"To us, his was the brightest of the thousand points of light. In victory, he shared credit. When he lost, he shouldered the blame. He accepted that failure is a part of living a full life but taught us never to be defined by failure. He showed us how setbacks can strengthen.",36.36,35-40
31,Emotional Eulogy for His Father,31_9,"None of his disappointments could compare with one of life's greatest tragedies, the loss of a young child. Jeb and I were too young to remember the pain and agony he and Mom felt when our 3-year-old sister died. We only learned later that Dad, a man of quiet faith, prayed for her daily. He was sustained by the love of the Almighty, and the real and enduring love of our mom. Dad always believed that one day he would hug his precious Robin again.",40.91,40-45
31,Emotional Eulogy for His Father,31_10,"He loved to laugh, especially at himself. He could tease and needle, but never out of malice. He placed great value on a good joke. That's why he chose Simpson to speak. On email, he had a circle of friends with whom he shared or received the latest jokes.",45.45,45-50
31,Emotional Eulogy for His Father,31_11,"His grading system for the quality of the joke was classic George Bush: The rare sevens and eights were considered huge winners, most of them off-color. George Bush knew how to be a true and loyal friend. He nurtured and honored many — his many friendships — with a generous and giving soul. There exists thousands of handwritten notes encouraging or sympathizing or thanking his friends and acquaintances. He had an enormous capacity to give of himself.",50.0,50-55
31,Emotional Eulogy for His Father,31_12,"Many a person would tell you that Dad became a mentor and a father figure in their life. He listened and he consoled. He was their friend. I think of Don Rhodes, Taylor Blanton, Jim Nantz, Arnold Schwarzenegger and, perhaps the unlikeliest of all, the man who defeated him, Bill Clinton. My siblings and I refer to the guys in this group as brothers from other mothers.",54.55,50-55
31,Emotional Eulogy for His Father,31_13,"He taught us that a day was not meant to be wasted. He played golf at a legendary pace. I always wondered why he insisted on speed golf. He was a good golfer. Well, here's my conclusion: He played fast so that he could move on to the next event, to enjoy the rest of the day, to expend his enormous energy, to live it all.",59.09,55-60
31,Emotional Eulogy for His Father,31_14,"He was born with just two settings: full throttle, then sleep. He taught us what it means to be a wonderful father, grandfather and great grandfather. He was firm in his principles, and supportive as we began to seek our own ways. He encouraged and comforted but never steered. We tested his patience.",63.64,60-65
31,Emotional Eulogy for His Father,31_15,"I know I did. But he always responded with the great gift of unconditional love. Last Friday, when I was told he had minutes to live, I called him. The guy who answered the phone said, ""He — I think he can hear you, but he hasn't said anything for most of the day."" I said, ""Dad, I love you, and you've been a wonderful father.""",68.18,65-70
31,Emotional Eulogy for His Father,31_16,"And the last words he would ever say on Earth were,""I love you, too."" To us, he was close to perfect. But not totally perfect. His short game was lousy. He wasn't exactly Fred Astaire on the dance floor.",72.73,70-75
31,Emotional Eulogy for His Father,31_17,"The man couldn't stomach vegetables, especially broccoli. And by the way, he passed these genetic defects along to us. Finally, every day of his 73 years of marriage, Dad taught us all what it means to be a great husband. He married his sweetheart. He adored her.",77.27,75-80
31,Emotional Eulogy for His Father,31_18,"He laughed and cried with her. He was dedicated to her, totally. In his old age, Dad enjoyed watching police show reruns, the volume on high. All the while, holding Mom's hand. After Mom died, Dad was strong, but all he really wanted to do was hold Mom's hand again.",81.82,80-85
31,Emotional Eulogy for His Father,31_19,"Of course, Dad taught me another special lesson. He showed me what it means to be a president who serves with integrity, leads with courage and acts with love in his heart for the citizens of our country. When the history books are written, they will say that George H.W. Bush was a great president of the United States, a diplomat of unmatched skill, a commander in chief of formidable accomplishment, and a gentleman who executed the duties of his office with dignity and honor. In his inaugural address, the 41st president of the United States said this: ""We cannot hope only to leave our children a bigger car, a bigger bank account. We must hope to give them a sense of what it means to be a loyal friend, a loving parent, a citizen who leaves his home, his neighborhood and town better than he found it.",86.36,85-90

Well, Dad, we're going to remember you for exactly that and much more. And we're going to miss you. Your decency, sincerity and kind soul will stay with us forever.",90.91,90-95

As we leave home for the first time to study at the places that we have worked so hard to get, we must not see or experience double standards. We need to see equal respect, leadership, and pay. The university experience must tell women that their brainpower is valued, and not just that, but that they belong within the leadership of the university itself.",83.33,80-85

A university should be a place of refuge that takes action against all forms of violence. That's why we believe that students should leave university believing in, striving for, and expecting societies of true equality. Societies of true equality in every sense, and that universities have the power to be a vital catalyst for that change.

Black people lived in separate areas to white people, they had different rules, they were segregated and this was particularly tough for me because I grew up in a mixed family, well, with me being the mixed one in the family. My mother's a black woman, a Xhosa woman from South Africa and in case you're wondering, Xhosa is one of the languages with the clicks in it, Xhosa. Xhosa but not like in American movies.",20.0,20-25

My mother's a beautiful, powerful woman who endured a lot during her life.",26.67,25-30
37,The Power of Information,37_5,"We lived through apartheid in South Africa, we lived through her going on to marry a man who was extremely abusive, an alcoholic and throughout all of that the one thing that I always admired in my mom was that she had the ability to appreciate the reality of the world she was in but also optimistically pursue the future that she wished to exist in and that's for me what Goalkeepers is all about, optimism. People always ask, they go is the world going to be in a better place? Is the world getting better or is it getting worse. Now, depending on who you ask there will always be a different answer. I've come to find one of the reasons I believe the world is getting better is because we have access to information on how bad the world actually is which I know is a strange thing to say but that's honestly what I believe.",33.33,30-35

You see people speaking out about what they see happening in Sudan, you see people commiserating and sharing with victims of hurricanes across the Caribbean or across Texas and whenever I look at that I go it's one of the most powerful tools that if harnessed correctly can lead to a completely new way that we communicate and that we change the world.

I believe that information and these tools that we possess today have helped increase that. More than ever we see that in America. As the host of The Daily Show I'm obviously in a world where we comment on news and politics and one thing I've noticed with my audience is not only are young people growing into the world of politics but they're engaged, engaged in a way that people were never engaged before, engaged in a way where they understand that they can actually change the course of history as opposed to just being a part of it.

People always come up to me and they go, Trevor, as the host of The Daily Show how do you feel about Donald Trump? I say well, I don't know how to feel about him that's the honest truth.

My mother always said to me, she said when we are laughing, we are not afraid. When we are laughing we are experiencing our truer selves.

In 1947, on her 21st birthday, she pledged in a broadcast from Cape Town to the Commonwealth to devote her life, whether it be short or long, to the service of her peoples.

The affection, admiration and respect she inspired became the hallmark of her reign.

The role and the duties of Monarchy also remain, as does the Sovereign's particular relationship and responsibility towards the Church of England — the Church in which my own faith is so deeply rooted. In that faith, and the values it inspires, I have been brought up to cherish a sense of duty to others, and to hold in the greatest respect the precious traditions, freedoms and responsibilities of our unique history and our system of parliamentary government.

41,Be Present!,41_2,"You know, I think, Lindsey as you know, Lindsey and I met when I was 17 and we both had a very similar spiritual belief system. And mine was a little more rooted in, a little bit more of a noisy brain. You know, I had certain beliefs and desires and I wanted to be a certain type of person, but a lot of my thoughts were kind of, I guess rooted in the ego, you know. And when I say the ego, I don't necessarily mean arrogance.

But again, all that thinking is based on time, you're basing who you are and what you think you should be, on who you'll be tomorrow and who you were yesterday. So, for me, the most effective tool I've adopted is just trying to stay present.

But I certainly started to see a pattern where, whatever my struggles or challenges were at that age, if they were ever kind of met or satisfied, I started to see how the next day, my brain found new struggles and challenges to be at odds with.

It's surrendering, which I like to, it's you know, when you use the word surrender, you remember that there was a fight going on.",94.59,90-95

Mr. President, successive reports of the Secretary General have established that the embargo, particularly through its extraterritorial effects, has adversely affected the Cuban people and the developmental efforts of the country, with particularly devastating effects owing to shortages of essential commodities.

But the most staggering statistic that I found was that foster care children are four times more likely to be exposed to sexual abuse. That's a breeding ground for trafficking.

Now there's a lot of rhetoric that's going on in the world right now about job creation in the United States. Well, if we want to create jobs in the United States I would ask you to consider eliminating slavery from the pipelines of corporations because a lot of that slavery is happening abroad.

Places like Tuvalu, with a population of just over 11,000 people, barely contributes to global emissions but is paying the price for our collective inaction.

They have never met you, nor you them. But I can tell you that their expectations on us all are high. Meeting those expectations will require us to use every policy lever available – and, just like the Christchurch Call to Action, we need to work with partners inside and outside government to make change.",58.06,55-60

We may only make up 0.17% of global emissions, but like so many others, our gross emissions have been rising steadily since the 1990s. That's why we have coupled ambition with action. Over the past two years since we took office New Zealand has produced our own Zero Carbon legislation, which puts our domestic economic transformation in line with the objective of a 1.5°C limit in global temperature increase.

Our food production for the world. We know this requires us to adapt. In fact our farming leaders have made their own commitment to cutting emissions from food production. Over the next five years we will collaborate with farmers to build systems in New Zealand which every farmer will be able to use to measure, manage and reduce their own farm's emissions.",67.74,65-70

53,Transforming India,53_3,"Let me answer that. I grew up in a family of eight children, a mother, a father, and a grandmother. My father was a school teacher in a small town. It was drilled into my young mind that my fate would be limited by the circumstances that I was born into. The India that I experienced in my youth was a lower-middle-class India with small hopes and even smaller dreams.",12.5,10-15
53,Transforming India,53_4,"I had simply accepted that there would be a glass ceiling to most professional ladders in corporate India of those days. Corruption and connections in government were common for success in most businesses then. That retrogressive mindset of mine changed gradually when I started working in a French real-time software company in Paris more than 50 years ago. I learned three important ideas: The power of entrepreneurship in a free market in creating jobs and prosperity for the nation. Second, the beauty of an enlightened corporate democracy and the role of compassionate capitalism in building a prosperous and happy country.",16.67,15-20

After learning these lessons, I decided to return to my hometown, Mysore, traversing Western and Eastern Europe, Israel, and West Asia, hitchhiking and spending just four to five dollars a day. That journey irrevocably transformed me from a confused leftist to a determined, compassionate capitalist. After I returned to India, I decided to conduct an experiment based on these three important ideas that I spoke about.

I wanted to create a company of the professional, for the professional, and by the professional, as Abe Lincoln defined a democracy. I wanted this corporate child of mine to be an expression of the best that the corporate world and society could offer. I wanted it to be a place where a person from any race, any religion, caste, nationality, and economic stratum could succeed based on competence and values.

Each one of these precepts has been a foundational pillar for building Infosys over the past four decades plus.

Five, how you behave when you are on top and have power and wealth is your true character. In such moments, your grace, your courtesy, and your humility shown to others will reveal the real you. Six, a confident leader hires people smarter than himself or herself.

Seventh, putting the interests of the company ahead of one's personal interests in the short and medium term results in the betterment of one's personal interests in the long term.

She almost sacrificed her queen.",6.67,5-10
55,3 Forms of Listening,55_3,"And then, about an hour into the game, I witnessed something astonishing happened. A dry, wily smile spread over her face – a smile that I had never seen – and she began to play well. Not just well – but very well. Every move that I made was countered by her move. I lost a rook, then a bishop, and then the whole kingdom.",10.0,10-15
55,3 Forms of Listening,55_4,"""Checkmate,"" she said triumphantly. And then I realized what had happened in the last half hour. She had learned to see the board through my eyes.

55,3 Forms of Listening,55_5,"She was listening to my brain, eavesdropping on my mind. This talk is not about talking, but about listening. Let me tell you a very different story: In the early 1950s, the mortality rate from childhood lymphoblastic leukemia – cancer of white blood cells – was 100 percent. Every child diagnosed with leukemia died.",16.67,15-20
55,3 Forms of Listening,55_6,"The illness was called a ""suppuration of blood"": because doctors thought that the blood had somehow suddenly turned rotten, and, like spoiled milk, there was no way of turning it back. But two young doctors in their thirties – Emil Frei and Emil Freireich – decided to launch an attack on childhood leukemia. They began to treat the kids with an experimental drug, a highly toxic form of chemotherapy. There was a brief, flickering response, but then all the patients relapsed. But far from backing off, Frei and Freireich doubled down, adding a second, even more, toxic form of chemotherapy.",20.0,20-25
55,3 Forms of Listening,55_7,"Then they added a third, and then a fourth. The effects of the combination chemo were terrifying – hair loss, infections, bleeding, organ failure. Other doctors began to call their hospital ward ""a butcher shop."" The remissions now strengthened to four and then eight months. Yet, still, every child relapsed and died.",23.33,20-25
55,3 Forms of Listening,55_8,"It was like playing a cellular chess match – a game against cancer. Every move that they made was met by a counterpoised move; a knight was traded for a knight, a pawn for a pawn. And that's when Frei and Freireich realized that they had to get into the ""mind"" of the disease. To solve these relapses, they had to know what game the leukemia was playing before the cancer made its next move. ""The best [doctors] seem to have a sixth sense about disease,"" one physician wrote.",26.67,25-30

""We began to understand its language, and its interior logic,"" Frei once told me. And so in the final round of experiments, they instilled chemotherapy directly into the brain and spinal cord of four and five-year-old children. And at last, these children began to be cured. The cure rates climbed magnificently – from forty percent to sixty percent, to seventy percent.",30.0,30-35
55,3 Forms of Listening,55_10,"Childhood leukemia is now among the most curable forms of cancer – about eighty percent of the time. This cure ranks among the singular achievements of modern medicine. It inspired one doctor to say, ""If I had the choice between walking on the moon and curing a child with cancer, I would never look at the moon again."" Which brings me back to listening. I want to talk to you today about the possibility – the requirement, even – of climbing out of your own heads and into another mind.",33.33,30-35
55,3 Forms of Listening,55_11,"It seems to me to be a uniquely human capacity (although to be fair, my wife swears that our dog can do it too, but that's just a very smart dog). In fact, I might argue that it's a definingly human capacity – and yet, oddly, there's no word in our language for it. This kind of listening takes three forms. The first is the kind that I experienced with my daughter. We occasionally term this ""empathy"" – but we need a different word here, for it could be purely strategic activity, as with my daughter entering my mind to beat me at chess, or a military general entering his or her enemy's head in the midst of a campaign, or a doctor entering the mind of an illness.",36.67,35-40
55,3 Forms of Listening,55_12,"The important feature of this kind of listening is that it asks you to do something nearly fantastical, like one of those transmorphic beings in Aliens: to abandon your own, private self – your identity, your past, your language – and to acquire the language, identity, skin of another person. What is it like to be him, or her? What is their suffering, or their joy, like? What makes them tick? What if I was born as that woman or that man?",40.0,40-45
55,3 Forms of Listening,55_13,"In a sense, all human conversation depends on the minor exercise of this faculty: every time we talk, we partly desire to enter each other's heads. This capacity is impaired in the severest forms of mental illness, leading to a person disturbingly unable to function in the world. That's the first kind of listening. The second involves listening to the past, listening to history – climbing, as it were, into the mind of history. ""History doesn't repeat itself, but it rhymes,"" is a quote attributed, perhaps apocryphally, to Mark Twain.",43.33,40-45
55,3 Forms of Listening,55_14,"To understand that rhyme – to comprehend the parts that come back, but with a slightly altered lilt, a slightly altered tone or emphasis – is also a profound form of listening. The third form of listening is the most abstract. It is listening to nature. It's the kind of listening that scientists aspire to, or artists often talk about: eavesdropping on the universe, learning its natural laws, its geometries, its rhythms, and constancies – its ""mind."" In medicine, it might take the form of listening to the inner logic of an illness.",46.67,45-50
55,3 Forms of Listening,55_15,"In physics: listening for equations that explain the cosmos. In literature: that illuminated moment when you've inhabited the characters on the page, or on the screen, so fully that they begin to speak back to you, like a gang of old friends. At the age of sixteen, Einstein asked himself what it would be to ride a beam of light. That question – what would it be like to inhabit the cosmos at its limits? What would it be like to ""BE"" light– would drive Einstein's scientific imagination for the rest of his life.",50.0,50-55
55,3 Forms of Listening,55_16,"Here's the main point: these three forms of listening – to another mind; to history; to nature – mark your entry into adulthood. You might think of these as the three sides of a uniquely human triangle, or a three-sided portal through which we must all pass: we are the only species that can learn to think like another of our own species; the only one that records and remembers its history; the only one that tries to decipher the laws of the universe. Psychologists speak of the immense transitional moment in a child when he or she acquires a social smile. Does every parent here remember the first time their child acquired their social smile? That's the moment that a child engages the world: she begins to come out of her own head.",53.33,50-55
55,3 Forms of Listening,55_17,"You might imagine your emergence into adulthood marked by another kind of engagement: by listening. It marks the completion of the ""coming out of your own head"" that you began, decades ago, with that first smile. I, for one, had not learned to listen when I graduated from college. It wasn't until three years later, when I was really in the thick of my studies in immunology, that I learned to listen to what an experiment had to say. That's when I made my first scientific discovery – about how viruses and cancers can learn to become invisible to the immune system.",56.67,55-60
55,3 Forms of Listening,55_18,"They do so, I learned, by tricking an ancient cellular system to recognize their ""foreign-ness."" I also learned that if you could undo this trick, you might goad your own immune system to detect the virus or cancer again – an idea that has emerged as one of the most exhilarating new themes in biology and medicine. I remember staying up past midnight looking at the radioactive counter tick-tick-ticking, waiting for the groaning old printer that was almost out of ink to print the pages of data, and realizing that I was, in fact, suddenly eavesdropping into one of the most profound mysteries of biology and the universe. It took me another four years before I learned to listen to a patient. In the first year of my residency, I cared for a young man with esophageal cancer.",60.0,60-65

55,3 Forms of Listening,55_20,"I don't want to be a casualty. I am not a soldier. I want a cookie"". I learned, that morning, that words like ""war"" and ""soldier"" don't work for everyone every time; that the restoration of sanctity and sovereignty and dignity is a goal in and of itself; that the art of doctoring is negotiating with hope.

But if I had pushed him too hard that morning, I would have lost him as a patient. And yes – ironically for a medical historian – I learned to listen to history last. I was a first-year fellow in oncology – you know the kind: aloof, exhausted, nose to the ground, the man in scrubs who snaps at you on the subway and tries to solve your crossword –when a woman asked me a question that stunned me: ""where are we in this fight, and who is going to win?""",73.33,70-75

I had no intention of becoming a writer, but that was the day I started writing my book that eventually grew and grew and grew into a 600-page history of cancer. I am telling you this because I wish someone had told me at my own commencement that the one and only requirement for graduation was not that I had to finish these many credits, or pull those many all-nighters, or attend these many late night mixers – or, for that matter, survive Drew Caspar's lectures on – but that I had to emerge out of the closed, cordoned-off, space of my own head.

I had promised that I would not contaminate this talk with the tawdriness of contemporary politics, but is it possible to ignore the fact that we have stopped listening to each other? Or, for that matter, stopped listening to the lessons of the past, or to natural laws? It seems that every toxic rupture in our culture – our willful depredations on the climate and the environment, the circus of our elected leaders who encourage us to ignore their personal history and national history, or those who take fail to defend the defenseless and who goad us to reject natural laws and facts – is, at its root, a rupture of listening.

History has proven time and time again that in the midst of the most difficult challenges, we have a chance to seize new opportunities and achieve our greatest victories.

61,WSU Tech 2020,61_9,"We pioneer new frontiers and reach new heights never before imagined. So today, as you begin a new chapter, I want to pass along three pieces of advice that I found helpful in my own life, especially during this time of national trial. First, as we all adjust to the social distancing practices, a rabbi recently gave his congregation a new call to action that I think is a great challenge for us all. He said, ""Every hand that we don't shake must become a phone call that we place. Every embrace we avoid must become a verbal expression of warmth and concern.",60.0,60-65
61,WSU Tech 2020,61_10,"Every inch and every foot that we physically place between ourselves and another must become a thought as to how we might be of help to that other should the need arise."" Imagine the happiness and joy we could bring to so many lonely people if we all practice these simple acts of kindness. We could all form at least one new habit or abandon an old destructive one to better appreciate the blessings of work, life, family, and faith. A recent article written by Charles Eisenstein explained this period in time this way. He wrote, ""When the crisis subsides, we might have occasion to ask whether we want to return to normal, or whether there may be something we've seen during this break in the routines that we want to bring into the future.""",66.67,65-70
61,WSU Tech 2020,61_11,"This is a great challenge. Even if the resolution is seemingly small, it could transform something in our lives. Some families have resolved to continue eating dinner together at least several times a week. People are using this time to acquire new skills through online platforms and want to continue to advance career certifications. Many Americans are spending more time in prayer and meditation and want to keep growing in their faith.",73.33,70-75
61,WSU Tech 2020,61_12,"Whatever your goal is, this is a unique time for each of us to make a change that we have perhaps long delayed and to grow in some way. Finally, right now I know the economic uncertainty is real and it's hard on many of you and your families. But I am confident that even if your path is different from the one you imagined, ultimately it can be better than we could ever have planned. In my own life, I've found that my greatest personal growth has arisen from times of discomfort and uncertainty that one can only really appreciate in hindsight.

64,Stanford Speech,64_5,"The minute I dropped out I could stop taking the required classes that didn't interest me, and begin dropping in on the ones that looked interesting. It wasn't all romantic. I didn't have a dorm room, so I slept on the floor in friends' rooms, I returned Coke bottles for the 5¢ deposits to buy food with, and I would walk the 7 miles across town every Sunday night to get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna temple. I loved it. And much of what I stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on.",17.24,15-20
64,Stanford Speech,64_6,"Let me give you one example: Reed College at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country. Throughout the campus every poster, every label on every drawer, was beautifully hand calligraphed. Because I had dropped out and didn't have to take the normal classes, I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this. I learned about serif and sans serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great. It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can't capture, and I found it fascinating.",20.69,20-25
64,Stanford Speech,64_7,"None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life. But 10 years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac. It was the first computer with beautiful typography. If I had never dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts.",24.14,20-25
64,Stanford Speech,64_8,"And since Windows just copied the Mac, it's likely that no personal computer would have them. If I had never dropped out, I would have never dropped in on this calligraphy class, and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do. Of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college. But it was very, very clear looking backward 10 years later. Again, you can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backward.",27.59,25-30
64,Stanford Speech,64_9,"So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something — your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life. My second story is about love and loss. I was lucky — I found what I loved to do early in life.",31.03,30-35
64,Stanford Speech,64_10,"Woz and I started Apple in my parents' garage when I was 20. We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4,000 employees. We had just released our finest creation — the Macintosh — a year earlier, and I had just turned 30. And then I got fired. How can you get fired from a company you started?",34.48,30-35
64,Stanford Speech,64_11,"Well, as Apple grew we hired someone who I thought was very talented to run the company with me, and for the first year or so things went well. But then our visions of the future began to diverge and eventually we had a falling out. When we did, our Board of Directors sided with him. So at 30 I was out. And very publicly out.",37.93,35-40
64,Stanford Speech,64_12,"What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone, and it was devastating. I really didn't know what to do for a few months. I felt that I had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down — that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me. I met with David Packard and Bob Noyce and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly. I was a very public failure, and I even thought about running away from the valley.",41.38,40-45
64,Stanford Speech,64_13,"But something slowly began to dawn on me — I still loved what I did. The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit. I had been rejected, but I was still in love. And so I decided to start over. I didn't see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me.",44.83,40-45
64,Stanford Speech,64_14,"The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life. During the next five years, I started a company named NeXT, another company named Pixar, and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife. Pixar went on to create the world's first computer animated feature film, Toy Story, and is now the most successful animation studio in the world. In a remarkable turn of events, Apple bought NeXT, I returned to Apple, and the technology we developed at NeXT is at the heart of Apple's current renaissance.",48.28,45-50

64,Stanford Speech,64_16,"I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did. You've got to find what you love. And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.",55.17,55-60
64,Stanford Speech,64_17,"If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking until you find it.",58.62,55-60
64,Stanford Speech,64_18,"Don't settle. My third story is about death. When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like: ""If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you'll most certainly be right."" It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: ""If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?"" And whenever the answer has been ""No"" for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.",62.07,60-65
64,Stanford Speech,64_19,"Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything — all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure — these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.",65.52,65-70
64,Stanford Speech,64_20,"About a year ago I was diagnosed with cancer. I had a scan at 7:30 in the morning, and it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas. I didn't even know what a pancreas was. The doctors told me this was almost certainly a type of cancer that is incurable, and that I should expect to live no longer than three to six months. My doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order, which is doctor's code for prepare to die.",68.97,65-70

It means to make sure everything is buttoned up so that it will be as easy as possible for your family. It means to say your goodbyes. I lived with that diagnosis all day. Later that evening I had a biopsy, where they stuck an endoscope down my throat, through my stomach and into my intestines, put a needle into my pancreas and got a few cells from the tumor.",72.41,70-75
64,Stanford Speech,64_22,"I was sedated, but my wife, who was there, told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope the doctors started crying because it turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is curable with surgery. I had the surgery and I'm fine now. This was the closest I've been to facing death, and I hope it's the closest I get for a few more decades. Having lived through it, I can now say this to you with a bit more certainty than when death was a useful but purely intellectual concept: No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there.",75.86,75-80
64,Stanford Speech,64_23,"And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life. It is Life's change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new.",79.31,75-80
64,Stanford Speech,64_24,"Right now the new is you, but someday not too long from now, you will gradually become the old and be cleared away. Sorry to be so dramatic, but it is quite true. Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma — which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice.",82.76,80-85

Stewart and his team put out several issues of The Whole Earth Catalog, and then when it had run its course, they put out a final issue. It was the mid-1970s, and I was your age.

It's also an honor to join forces with Educated Child, an organization led by a woman who is an amazing role model — a woman who has shown such relentless dedication to getting every child in school. This is such an exciting day for us because it marks the beginning of a new era in my home country Colombia. Most of you may know me as an artist, as an entertainer, and that's indeed my calling and what I've been doing since I was 13 years old, but I never would have imagined when I started out that my work as an artist would end up being the vehicle for me to serve my greater purpose in life of working towards eradicating poverty through the power of Education.",0.0,0-5

Where people don't access equal opportunities, and because of that generation after generation, after generation live trapped in the same vicious cycle fed by prejudice and inaction. Growing up in my country when I was around eight years old, I remember I saw kids my age who, instead of being in school were already working in the streets, were barefoot in the park. Kids like me whose reality was completely different than mine only because of the circumstances into which they were born.",11.11,10-15
68,Education Changes the World,68_2,"It was really hard for me to accept that to accept that something so unjust didn't have a solution. There had to be something that could be done. So I often asked myself why the adults, around me were so resigned to the fact that these kids who were just like me or even their own children we're living in a parallel reality so different and so cruel. As Kofi Annan put it, poverty is intolerable in a world of plenty, so as soon as I had some success, the first thing I wanted to do was to invest as many resources I could into what later would become the most meaningful project of my life, working for children. So I set out to find a team, a team of people who dream big and worked hard and thought like me to help me right the wrongs that I had witnessed throughout my entire childhood, and that's when our foundation The Barefoot Foundation, 'Pies Descalzos Fundacion' was born.",22.22,20-25

So, I really felt that I needed to learn what the roots of inequality and low social mobility were. So, I decided to study the reasons why children were working in the streets or why some children were being recruited by the violent organizations, like the paramilitary or the guerrillas, why were so many children suffering from chronic malnutrition and I realized that most of the issues that children face in my country had and have a common denominator; the lack of access to quality education. To me, it became crystal clear that Education was a surest way to give all these kids the best fighting chance of improving their circumstances in life because Education is the great equalizer. When I started building schools in Colombia, which shows the most remote areas, areas where there was literally nothing, no infrastructure, no paved roads, no electricity, no potable water, and we decided to build in those places but not only build schools but state-of-the-art schools.",33.33,30-35

We noticed that as soon as a school is built in those places, everything is transformed. The improvements to the infrastructure were jaw-dropping electricity, and potable water were made available, made accessible. Roads were paved, malnutrition plummeted, but the best part of all is the academic results, the kids really responded academically, and now those kids who could have been recruited by the guerrillas or paramilitaries or that could have had a completely different outcomes for their lives, they're now on their way to the University and thriving in their communities.

Now that said, our work is far from being done, many developing countries are still rife with inequality and internal conflict, and there are a lot of kids who still need to be reached. History is not only the past. History it's made every day in the present, and what matters now is how we go forward and how we'll fix what's wrong, and that is the real challenge.

For instance, if all students in low-income countries left primary school with basic reading skills, a hundred and seventy-one million people could be lifted out of poverty. Systemic change often begins from the bottom up rather than the top down. The government must take responsibility, and we should all put as much pressure as we possibly can, but the rest of all the civil society should also do their part. What we have discovered both here IPS discuss and educated child is that many times only one single barrier to entry, such as no access to transportation or basic needs like a functioning bathroom, can prevent a kid from attending school or even put them at risk of dropping out.",66.67,65-70

The biggest effort really is in mapping the communities; in going door-to-door searching for the out of school children talking to the parents talking to their families, giving a name and putting a story behind these children is the first step to start rewriting their story. Over the next three years, we pledge to get fifty-four thousand kids who are out of school or at risk of drop out into the educational system. Ultimately, more than two hundred ninety-five thousand people will benefit from this project, including children, teachers, families, and community members.

We would then get onto the subway together and, when we surfaced, he would ask me ""Which way is north?"" I wasn't very good at finding North at the beginning, but I auditioned fair amount and so my Dad kept asking ""Which way is north?""",0.0,0-5
70,Paid Family Leave,70_1,"Over time, I got better at finding it. I was struck by that memory yesterday while boarding the plane to come here. Not just by how far my life has come since then, but by how meaningful that seemingly small lesson has been. When I was still a child, my father developed my sense of direction and now, as an adult, I trust my ability to navigate space. My father helped give me the confidence to guide myself through the world.",5.56,5-10
70,Paid Family Leave,70_2,"In late March, last year, 2016, I became a parent for the first time. I remember the indescribable—and as I understand a pretty universal—experience of holding my week-old son and feeling my priorities change on a cellular level. I remember I experienced a shift in consciousness that gave me the ability to maintain my love of career and cherish something else, someone else, so much, much more. Like so many parents, I wondered how I was going to balance my work with my new role as a parent, and in that moment, I remember that the statistic for the US's policy on maternity leave flashed in my mind. American women are currently entitled to 12 weeks' unpaid leave.",11.11,10-15
70,Paid Family Leave,70_3,"American men are entitled to nothing. That information landed differently for me when, one week after my son's birth I could barely walk. That information landed different when I was getting to know a human who was completely dependent on my husband and I for everything, when I was dependent on my husband for most things, when we were relearning everything we thought we knew about our family and relationship. It landed differently. Somehow, we and every American parent were expected to be ""back to normal"" in under three months.",16.67,15-20
70,Paid Family Leave,70_4,"Without income. I remember thinking to myself, ""If the practical reality of pregnancy is another mouth to feed in your home and America is a country where most people are living paycheck to paycheck, how does 12 weeks unpaid leave economically work?"" The truth is, for too many people it doesn't. One in four American women go back to work two weeks after giving birth because they can't afford to take any more time off than that. That's 25 per cent of American women.",22.22,20-25
70,Paid Family Leave,70_5,"Equally disturbing, women who can afford to take the full 12 weeks often don't because it will mean incurring a ""motherhood penalty""—meaning they will be perceived as less dedicated to their job and will be passed over for promotions and other career advancement. In my own household, my mother had to choose between a career and raising three children – a choice that left her unpaid and underappreciated as a homemaker – because there just wasn't support for both paths. The memory of being in the city with my Dad is a particularly meaningful one since he was the sole breadwinner in our house, and my brothers and my time with him was always limited by how much he had to work. And we were an incredibly privileged family — our hardships were the stuff of other family's dreams. The deeper into the issue of paid parental leave I go, the clearer I see the connection between persisting barriers to women's full equality and empowerment, and the need to redefine and in some cases, destigmatize men's role as caregivers.",27.78,25-30
70,Paid Family Leave,70_6,"In other words, in order to liberate women, we need to liberate men. The assumption and common practice that women and girls look after the home and the family is a stubborn and very real stereotype that not only discriminates against women, but limits men's participation and connection within the family and society. These limitations have broad-ranging and significant effects, for them and for children. We know this. So why do we continue to undervalue fathers and overburden mothers?",33.33,30-35
70,Paid Family Leave,70_7,"Paid parental leave is not about taking days off work; it is about creating freedom to define roles, to choose how to invest time, and to establish new, positive cycles of behavior. Companies that have offered paid parental leave for employees have reported improved employee retention, reduced absenteeism and training costs, and boosted productivity and morale. Far from not being able to afford to have paid parental leave, it seems we can't afford not to. In fact, a study in Sweden showed that every month fathers took paternity leave, the mothers' income increased by 6.7 per cent. That's 6.7 per cent more economic freedom for the whole family.",38.89,35-40
70,Paid Family Leave,70_8,"Data from the International Men and Gender Equality Survey shows that most fathers report that they would work less if it meant that they could spend more time with their children. And picking up on the thread that the prime minister mentioned I'd like to ask: How many of us here today saw our Dads enough growing up? How many of you Dads here see your kids enough now?We need to help each other if we are going to grow. Along with UN Women, I am issuing a call to action for countries, companies and institutions globally to step-up and become champions for paid parental leave. In 2013, provisions for parental leave were in only 66 countries out of 190 UN member states.",44.44,40-45
70,Paid Family Leave,70_9,"I look forward to beginning with the UN itself which has not yet achieved parity and who's paid parental leave policies are currently up for review. All you're going to see a lot of me. Let us lead by example in creating a world in which women and men are not economically punished for wanting to be parents. I don't mean to imply that you need to have children to care about and benefit from this issue — whether or not you have — or want kids, you will benefit by living in a more evolved world with policies not based on gender. We all benefit from living in a more compassionate time where our needs do not make us weak, they make us fully human.",50.0,50-55
70,Paid Family Leave,70_10,"Maternity leave, or any workplace policy based on gender, can—at this moment in history—only ever be a gilded cage. Though it was created to make life easier for women, we now know it creates a perception of women as being inconvenient to the workplace. We now know it chains men to an emotionally limited path. And it cannot, by definition, serve the reality of a world in which there is more than one type of family. Because in the modern world, some families have two daddies.",55.56,55-60
70,Paid Family Leave,70_11,"How exactly does maternity leave serve them? Today, on International Women's Day, I would like to thank all those who went before in creating our current policies—let us honour them and build upon what they started by shifting our language – and therefore our consciousness—away from gender and towards opportunity. Let us honor our own parents sacrifice by creating a path for a more fair, farther the reaching truth to define all of our lives, especially the lives our children. Because paid parental leave does more than give more time for parents to spend with their kids. It changes the story of what children observe, and will from themselves imagine possible.",61.11,60-65
70,Paid Family Leave,70_12,"I see cause for hope. In my own country, the United States—currently the only high-income country in the world without paid maternity let alone parental leave—great work has begun in the states of New York, California, New Jersey, Rhode Island and Washington which are currently implementing paid parental leave programs. First Lady Charlene McCray and Mayor Bill de Blasio have granted paid parental leave to over 20,000 government employees in NYC. We can do this. Bringing about change cannot just be the responsibility of those who need it most; we must have the support of those at the highest levels of power if we are ever to achieve parity.",66.67,65-70
70,Paid Family Leave,70_13,"That is why it is such an honor to recognize and congratulate pioneers of paid parental leave like the global company Danone. Today I am proud to announce Danone Global CEO, Emmanuel Faber as our inaugural HeForShe Thematic Champion for Paid Parental Leave. As part of this announcement, Danone will implement a global 18 weeks gender-neutral paid parental leave policy for the company's 100,000 employees by the year 2020.

The handloom weaver's for example famed across the world whose products were exported around the world, Britain came right in. There were actually these weaver's making fine muslin as light as woven wear, it was said, and Britain came right in, smashed their thumbs, broke their looms, imposed tariffs and duties on their cloth and products and started, of course, taking their raw material from India and shipping back manufactured cloth flooding the world's markets with what became the products of the dark and satanic mills of the Victoria in England. That meant that the weavers in India became beggars and India went from being a world famous exporter of finished cloth into an importer when from having 27 per cent of the world trade to less than 2 per cent.",11.11,10-15

And the British had the gall to call him Clive of India as if he belonged to the country, when all he really did was to ensure that much of the country belonged to him. By the end of 19th century, the fact is that India was already Britain's biggest cash cow, the world's biggest purchaser of British goods and exports and the source for highly paid employment for British civil servants. We literally paid for our own oppression. And as has been pointed out, the worthy British Victorian families that made their money out of the slave economy, one fifth of the elites of the wealthy class in Britain in 19th century owed their money to transporting 3 million Africans across the waters.",16.67,15-20

I was struck by the fact that your Wi-Fi password at this Union commemorates the name of Mr Gladstone – the great liberal hero. Well, I am very sorry his family was one of those who benefited from this compensation. Staying with India between 15-29 million Indians died of starvation in British induced famines. The most famous example was, of course, was the great Bengal famine during the World War II when 4 million people died because Winston Churchill deliberately as a matter of written policy proceeded to divert essential supplies from civilians in Bengal to sturdy tummies and Europeans as reserve stockpiles.",22.22,20-25

So, all notions that the British were trying to do their colonial enterprise out of enlightened despotism to try and bring the benefits of colonialism and civilisation to the benighted. Even I am sorry – Churchill's conduct in 1943 is simply one example of many that gave light to this myth.

Let me take the World War I as a very concrete example since the first speaker Mr. Lee suggested these couldn't be quantified. Let me quantify World War I for you. Again I am sorry from an Indian perspective as others have spoken abut the countries. One-sixth of all the British forces that fought in the war were Indian – 54 000 Indians actually lost their lives in that war, 65 000 were wounded and another 4000 remained missing or in prison.",33.33,30-35

I know all this because the commemoration of the centenary has just taken place. But not just that, India had to supply 173,000 animals 370 million tonnes of supplies and in the end the total value of everything that was taken out of India and India by the way was suffering from recession at that time and poverty and hunger, was in today's money 8 billion pounds.

I won't believe it to the point but Britain's total war debt of 3 billion pounds in 1945 money, 1.25 billion was owed to India and never actually paid. Somebody mentioned Scotland, well the fact is that colonialism actually cemented your union with Scotland. The Scots had actually tried to send colonies out before 1707, they had all failed, I am sorry to say. But, then of course, came union and India was available",44.44,40-45

Now that India is no longer there, no wonder the bonds are loosening. Now we have heard other arguments on this side and there has been a mention of railways. Well let me tell you first of all as my colleague the Jamaican High Commissioner has pointed out, the railways and roads were really built to serve British interests and not those of the local people but I might add that many countries have built railways and roads without having had to be colonalised in order to do so. They were designed to carry raw materials from the hinterland into the ports to be shipped to Britain.",50.0,50-55

Transportation – there was no attempt made to match supply from demand from as transports, none what so ever. Instead in fact the Indian railways were built with massive incentives offered by Britain to British investors, guaranteed out of Indian taxes paid by Indians with the result that you actually had one mile of Indian railway costing twice what it cost to built the same mile in Canada or Australia because there was so much money being paid in extravagant returns. Britain made all the profits, controlled the technology, supplied all the equipment and absolutely all these benefits came as British private enterprise at Indian public risk. That was the railways as an accomplishment.",55.56,55-60
73,Britain owes reparations to India,73_11,"We are hearing about aid, I think it was Sir Richard Ottaway mentioned British aid to India. Well let me just point out that the British aid to India is about 0.4 per cent of India's GDP. The government of India actually spends more on fertiliser subsidies which might be an appropriate metaphor for that argument. If I may point out as well that as my fellow speakers from the proposition have pointed out there have been incidents of racial violence, of loot, of massacres, of blood shed, of transportation and in India's case even one of our last Mughal emperors. Yes, may be today's Britains are not responsible for some of these reparations but the same speakers have pointed with pride to their foreign aid – you are not responsible for the people starving in Somalia but you give them aid surely the principle of reparation for what is the wrongs that have done cannot be denied.",61.11,60-65

So there is a moral debt that needs to be paid. Someone challenged reparations elsewhere. Well I am sorry Germany doesn't just give reparations to Israel, it also gives reparations to Poland perhaps some of the speakers here are too young to remember the dramatic picture of Charles William Brunt on his knees in the Walter Gaiter in 1970. There are other examples, there is Italy's reparations to Libya, there is Japan's to Korea even Britain has paid reparations to the New Zealand Maoris.",66.67,65-70

The first speaker Mr. Lee in particular conceded all the evil atrocities of the colonialism but essentially suggested that reparations won't really help, they won't help the right people, they would be use of propaganda tools, they will embolden people like Mr Mugabe. So, it's nice how in the old days, I am sorry to say that either people of the Caribbean used to frighten their children into behaving and sleeping by saying some Francis Drake would come up after them that was the legacy, now Mugabe will be there – the new sort of Francis Drake of our time.",77.78,75-80

Certainly no amount of money can expedite the loss of a loved one as somebody pointed out there. You are not going to figure out the exact amount but the principle is what matters. The fact is that to speak blithely of sacrifices on both sides as an analogy was used here – a burglar comes into your house and sacks the place but stubs his toe and you say that there was sacrifice on both sides that I am sorry to say is not an acceptable argument. The truth is that we are not arguing specifically that vast some of money needs to be paid.",83.33,80-85

The question is, is there a debt, does Britain owe reparations? As far as I am concerned, the ability to acknowledge your wrong that has been done, to simply say sorry will go a far far far longer way than some percentage of GDP in the form of aid. What is required it seems to me is accepting the principle that reparations are owed.

From Bangladesh and Bosnia to South Sudan to East Timor, he spent the majority of his career in the field, working alongside people forced from their homes by war, and assisting them with his skill as a diplomat and negotiator. Perhaps the greatest testament to his contribution, is how much his advice would be valued today. As the Syrian conflict enters its seventh year, as we live through the gravest refugee crisis since the founding of the United Nations, as 20 million people are on the brink of death from starvation in Yemen, Somalia, South Sudan and northeast Nigeria, I cannot imagine that there is anyone in the leadership of the United Nations who would not welcome the opportunity to consult Sergio, or send him into the field once more.

I felt profound sadness at the fact that the conflict in Iraq – the source of so much Iraqi suffering to this day – had claimed the lives of men and women whose only intention was to try and improve a desperate situation. But I also saw clearly the value and nobility of a life spent in service of others. Sergio was a man who never turned down an assignment, no matter how difficult and dangerous – or as others have put it, was ""handed one impossible task after another"".",8.7,5-10

Hundreds of UN staff have served, and continue to, serve in Iraq, as they do from Afghanistan to Somalia, because the task of building peace and security can never be abandoned, no matter how bleak the situation.

We see a rising tide of nationalism, masquerading as patriotism, and the re-emergence of policies encouraging fear and hatred of others. We see some politicians elected partly on the basis of dismissing international institutions and agreements, as if our countries have not benefited from cooperation, but actually been harmed by it. We hear some leaders talking as if some of our proudest achievements are in fact our biggest liabilities – whether it is the tradition of successfully integrating refugees into our societies, or the institutions and treaties we have built rooted in laws and human rights. We see nations that played a proud role in the founding of the International Criminal Court withdrawing from it, on the one hand, and on the other, we see arrest warrants for alleged war crimes issued but not implemented, and other crimes ignored altogether.",21.74,20-25

And we see resolutions and laws on the protection of civilians and the use of chemical weapons, for instance, flouted repeatedly, in some cases under the cover of Security Council vetoes, as in Syria. Many of these things are not new – but taken together – and in the absence of strong international leadership, they are deeply worrying. When we consider all this and more, as citizens, what is our answer? Do we, as some would encourage us to think, turn our backs on the world, and hope we can wait for storms to pass?",26.09,25-30
76,What We Stand For,76_7,"Or do we strengthen our commitment to diplomacy and to the United Nations? I strongly believe there is only one choice, demanded by reason as well as by conscience, which is the hard work of diplomacy and negotiation and reform of the UN. This is not to say that that is anyway an easy road. And there are reasons people feel insecure today. The level of conflict and lack of solutions combined with the fear of terrorism; the reality that globalization has bought vast benefits to some but worsened the lot of others; the sense of a disconnect between citizens and governments, or in some countries the lack of governance; the overall feeling that for all our gains in technology and connectedness, we are less in control of forces shaping our lives – all these factors and more have contributed to a sense of a world out of balance, and there are no easy answers.",30.43,30-35

76,What We Stand For,76_10,"It includes the view that success isn't being better or greater than others but finding your place in a world where others succeed too. And that a strong nation, like a strong person, helps others to rise up and be independent. It is the spirit that made possible the creation of the UN, out of the rubble and ruin and 60 million dead of World War Two; so that even before the task of defeating Nazism was complete, that generation of wartime leaders was forging the United Nations. If governments and leaders are not keeping that flame of internationalism alive today, then we as citizens must. The challenge is how to restore that sense of balance and hopefulness in our countries, while not sacrificing all we have learnt about the value and necessity of internationalism.",43.48,40-45
76,What We Stand For,76_11,"Because a world in which we turn our back on our global responsibilities will be a world that produces greater insecurity, violence, and danger for us and for our children.

We have to challenge the idea that the strongest leaders are those most willing to dismiss human rights on the grounds of national interest. The strongest leaders are those who are capable of pursuing both.",47.83,45-50
76,What We Stand For,76_12,"Having strong values and the will to act upon them doesn't weaken our borders or our militaries – it is their essential foundation. None of this is to say that the UN is perfect. Of course, it is not. I have never met a field officer who has not railed against its shortcomings, as I imagine Sergio did in his darkest moments. He, like all of us, wanted a UN that was more decisive, less bureaucratic, and that lived up to its standards.",52.17,50-55

We have to recognize the damage we do when we undermine the UN or use it selectively – or not at all – or when we rely on aid to do the job of diplomacy, or give the UN impossible tasks and then underfund it. For example today, there is not a single humanitarian appeal anywhere in the world that is funded by even half of what is required. In fact, it is worse than that. Appeals for countries on the brink of famine today are 17%, 7%, and 5% funded, for example.",60.87,60-65

It is what we spend in countries where we have no diplomacy or our diplomacy is not working.

Patience, acceptance, tolerance, adaptability, compassion, empathy are the qualities which have been engraved in us, right when we choose to become doctors and took the Hippocratic Oath, which binds us, not just to the patients, our colleagues, and our profession, but to the humanity as a whole.

And we need more research-oriented programs and fellowships, more of them which, you know, in the US, some of the fellowships which we are not even aware of here. But let me tell you, with necessary changes made, we the youth are ready to, you know, contribute our best to the nation and I'm sure, you know, with amazing doctors like you all, and we youngsters, and AAPI coming forward and the government coming forward, we are sure to see India as the number one healthcare leader in the coming days.

Introducing yoga or any sort of physical activity into the you know, right from the childhood will develop a lifestyle habit and prevent them from having non-communicable diseases in their future.

Why should profession, you know, career and our passion be an either or, or option. All of us, you know, here are doctors who are specialized in to different fields, but what makes us unique is that balance. To be able to balance our passion and profession, you know, balancing your work and family, you know, it is as important as balancing your passion and profession.

Make at least one, you know, a few hours out of your busy week, one day in a week, if you can, you know, make hours for your passion, then I think it'll keep you happy.

And the beauty of technology is that it connects us to millions of people, a click of a button helps us connects to millions of people and give them the right medical information at the right time. And the next big thing that is going to happen, that is already happening, is our online clinics. But there are definitely pros and cons for everything. This, you know, the pros we already know, but the disadvantages being that, you know, some of the quacks may utilize this opportunity to give wrong information and wrong treatment, which I think, with some kind of regulations from the government, we can definitely curtail that.",66.67,65-70

80,Global Health Care,80_21,"And you being the enlightening factor for people around you who are watching you online. There is a huge difference between both of these. All of us youngsters here, you know, when it comes to online presence, I think it is important that we look beyond browsing the celebrity lives and become an inspiration by ourselves and you know, become a motivating factor for everybody who's watching you online, right? And to be able to be successful, the only key is to utilize your time properly and your opportunities properly, to dream big, have a vision and to execute that vision with a discipline and have a positive outlook towards your life, believe in the supreme power and believe in your own self.

I have failed once, I have failed twice and thrice. But, you know, waking up again the next day morning and having a new hope again, is what made me stand again in front of y'all. There is a difference between winning and being successful, okay?",81.48,80-85
80,Global Health Care,80_23,"I never considered winning any of these competitions as being successful. For me, success is about, you know, waking up after you fail. For me, success is about overcoming the challenges and societal norms, being disciplined, being consistent in your hard work, being happy with what you have and satisfied with what you have is success for me. Making my country proud, making my parents proud and my teachers proud is success to me. I think we've seen this, you know, a lot of times it's been forwarded on our phones, that the winner stands like this and the person who got third will be celebrating the success, right?",85.19,85-90
80,Global Health Care,80_24,"So that means that, you know, the position or winning is not success absolutely. Being happy with what you have and enjoying your journey and, you know, exploring yourself and being able to, you know, chase your passion is success to me. And at the end of our lives, there shouldn't be any point where you look back and say, I wish I had done that. There should be a point where you have to say that, I chased my passion and I did that, you know.

The last few years have seen an amazing explosion of economic, social and political empowerment.

That's the way you want to set the world on fire. The young people that were mentioned in my introduction who have been part of our global initiative community for university students made very specific commitments.

They promised an educational exchange with the National University of Rwanda. We can learn a lot from them, because they lost 10 percent of their people in ninety days to a genocide in 1994, and they came back because they refused to be paralyzed by the past.

Every single one of these is part of an ongoing battle to define the terms of our interdependence. Will we do it in positive or negative terms?

Not only has Harvard given me an extraordinary honour, but the weeks of fear and nausea I have endured at the thought of giving this commencement address have made me lose weight.

The commencement speaker that day was the distinguished British philosopher Baroness Mary Warnock. Reflecting on her speech has helped me enormously in writing this one because it turns out that I can't remember a single word she said. This liberating discovery enables me to proceed without any fear that I might inadvertently influence you to abandon promising careers in business, the law or politics for the giddy delights of becoming a gay wizard. You see?",3.85,0-5

Actually, I have wracked my mind and heart for what I ought to say to you today. I have asked myself what I wish I had known at my own graduation, and what important lessons I have learned in the 21 years that have expired between that day and this. I have come up with two answers.",7.69,5-10

And as you stand on the threshold of what is sometimes called 'real life', I want to extol the crucial importance of imagination. These may seem quixotic or paradoxical choices, but please bear with me. Looking back at the 21-year-old that I was at graduation, is a slightly uncomfortable experience for the 42-year-old that she has become. Half my lifetime ago, I was striking an uneasy balance between the ambition I had for myself, and what those closest to me expected of me.",11.54,10-15
85,The Benefits Of Failure,85_4,"I was convinced that the only thing I wanted to do, ever, was to write novels. However, my parents, both of whom came from impoverished backgrounds and neither of whom had been to college, took the view that my overactive imagination was an amusing personal quirk that would never pay a mortgage, or secure a pension. I know that the irony strikes with the force of a cartoon anvil, now. So they hoped that I would take a vocational degree; I wanted to study English Literature. A compromise was reached that in retrospect satisfied nobody, and I went up to study Modern Languages.",15.38,15-20
85,The Benefits Of Failure,85_5,"Hardly had my parents' car rounded the corner at the end of the road than I ditched German and scuttled off down the Classics corridor. I cannot remember telling my parents that I was studying Classics; they might well have found out for the first time on graduation day. Of all the subjects on this planet, I think they would have been hard put to name one less useful than Greek mythology when it came to securing the keys to an executive bathroom. I would like to make it clear, in parenthesis, that I do not blame my parents for their point of view. There is an expiry date on blaming your parents for steering you in the wrong direction; the moment you are old enough to take the wheel, responsibility lies with you.",19.23,15-20
85,The Benefits Of Failure,85_6,"What is more, I cannot criticize my parents for hoping that I would never experience poverty. They had been poor themselves, and I have since been poor, and I quite agree with them that it is not an ennobling experience. Poverty entails fear, and stress, and sometimes depression; it means a thousand petty humiliations and hardships. Climbing out of poverty by your own efforts, that is indeed something on which to pride yourself, but poverty itself is romanticized only by fools. What I feared most for myself at your age was not poverty, but failure.",23.08,20-25
85,The Benefits Of Failure,85_7,"At your age, in spite of a distinct lack of motivation at university, where I had spent far too long in the coffee bar writing stories, and far too little time at lectures, I had a knack for passing examinations, and that, for years, had been the measure of success in my life and that of my peers. I am not dull enough to suppose that because you are young, gifted and well-educated, you have never known hardship or heartbreak. Talent and intelligence never yet inoculated anyone against the caprice of the Fates, and I do not for a moment suppose that everyone here has enjoyed an existence of unruffled privilege and contentment. However, the fact that you are graduating from Harvard suggests that you are not very well-acquainted with failure. You might be driven by a fear of failure quite as much as a desire for success.",26.92,25-30
85,The Benefits Of Failure,85_8,"Indeed, your conception of failure might not be too far from the average person's idea of success, so high have you already flown. Ultimately, we all have to decide for ourselves what constitutes failure, but the world is quite eager to give you a set of criteria if you let it. So I think it fair to say that by any conventional measure, a mere seven years after my graduation day, I had failed on an epic scale. An exceptionally short-lived marriage had imploded, and I was jobless, a lone parent, and as poor as it is possible to be in modern Britain, without being homeless. The fears that my parents had had for me, and that I had had for myself, had both come to pass, and by every usual standard, I was the biggest failure I knew.",30.77,30-35
85,The Benefits Of Failure,85_9,"Now, I am not going to stand here and tell you that failure is fun. That period of my life was a dark one, and I had no idea that there was going to be what the press has since represented as a kind of fairy tale resolution. I had no idea then how far the tunnel extended, and for a long time, any light at the end of it was a hope rather than a reality. So why do I talk about the benefits of failure? Simply because failure meant a stripping away of the inessential.",34.62,30-35

Had I really succeeded at anything else, I might never have found the determination to succeed in the one arena I believed I truly belonged. I was set free, because my greatest fear had been realised, and I was still alive, and I still had a daughter whom I adored, and I had an old typewriter and a big idea. And so rock bottom became the solid foundation on which I rebuilt my life. You might never fail on the scale I did, but some failure in life is inevitable.",38.46,35-40
85,The Benefits Of Failure,85_11,"It is impossible to live without failing at something, unless you live so cautiously that you might as well not have lived at all – in which case, you fail by default. Failure gave me an inner security that I had never attained by passing examinations. Failure taught me things about myself that I could have learned no other way. I discovered that I had a strong will, and more discipline than I had suspected; I also found out that I had friends whose value was truly above the price of rubies. The knowledge that you have emerged wiser and stronger from setbacks means that you are, ever after, secure in your ability to survive.",42.31,40-45
85,The Benefits Of Failure,85_12,"You will never truly know yourself, or the strength of your relationships, until both have been tested by adversity. Such knowledge is a true gift, for all that it is painfully won, and it has been worth more than any qualification I ever earned. So given a Time Turner, I would tell my 21-year-old self that personal happiness lies in knowing that life is not a check-list of acquisition or achievement. Your qualifications, your CV, are not your life, though you will meet many people of my age and older who confuse the two. Life is difficult, and complicated, and beyond anyone's total control, and the humility to know that will enable you to survive its vicissitudes.",46.15,45-50
85,The Benefits Of Failure,85_13,"Now you might think that I chose my second theme, the importance of imagination, because of the part it played in rebuilding my life, but that is not wholly so. Though I personally will defend the value of bedtime stories to my last gasp, I have learned to value imagination in a much broader sense. Imagination is not only the uniquely human capacity to envision that which is not, and therefore the fount of all invention and innovation. In its arguably most transformative and revelatory capacity, it is the power that enables us to empathise with humans whose experiences we have never shared. One of the greatest formative experiences of my life preceded Harry Potter, though it informed much of what I subsequently wrote in those books.",50.0,50-55
85,The Benefits Of Failure,85_14,"This revelation came in the form of one of my earliest day jobs. Though I was sloping off to write stories during my lunch hours, I paid the rent in my early 20s by working at the African research department at Amnesty International's headquarters in London. There in my little office I read hastily scribbled letters smuggled out of totalitarian regimes by men and women who were risking imprisonment to inform the outside world of what was happening to them. I saw photographs of those who had disappeared without trace, sent to Amnesty by their desperate families and friends. I read the testimony of torture victims and saw pictures of their injuries.",53.85,50-55
85,The Benefits Of Failure,85_15,"I opened handwritten, eye-witness accounts of summary trials and executions, of kidnappings and rapes. Many of my co-workers were ex-political prisoners, people who had been displaced from their homes, or fled into exile, because they had the temerity to speak against their governments. Visitors to our offices included those who had come to give information, or to try and find out what had happened to those they had left behind. I shall never forget the African torture victim, a young man no older than I was at the time, who had become mentally ill after all he had endured in his homeland. He trembled uncontrollably as he spoke into a video camera about the brutality inflicted upon him.",57.69,55-60
85,The Benefits Of Failure,85_16,"He was a foot taller than I was, and seemed as fragile as a child. I was given the job of escorting him back to the Underground Station afterwards, and this man whose life had been shattered by cruelty took my hand with exquisite courtesy, and wished me future happiness. And as long as I live I shall remember walking along an empty corridor and suddenly hearing, from behind a closed door, a scream of pain and horror such as I have never heard since. The door opened, and the researcher poked out her head and told me to run and make a hot drink for the young man sitting with her. She had just had to give him the news that in retaliation for his own outspokenness against his country's regime, his mother had been seized and executed.",61.54,60-65
85,The Benefits Of Failure,85_17,"Every day of my working week in my early 20s I was reminded how incredibly fortunate I was, to live in a country with a democratically elected government, where legal representation and a public trial were the rights of everyone. Every day, I saw more evidence about the evils humankind will inflict on their fellow humans, to gain or maintain power. I began to have nightmares, literal nightmares, about some of the things I saw, heard, and read. And yet I also learned more about human goodness at Amnesty International than I had ever known before. Amnesty mobilises thousands of people who have never been tortured or imprisoned for their beliefs to act on behalf of those who have.",65.38,65-70

Ordinary people, whose personal well-being and security are assured, join together in huge numbers to save people they do not know, and will never meet. My small participation in that process was one of the most humbling and inspiring experiences of my life. Unlike any other creature on this planet, humans can learn and understand, without having experienced. They can think themselves into other people's places.",69.23,65-70
85,The Benefits Of Failure,85_19,"Of course, this is a power, like my brand of fictional magic, that is morally neutral. One might use such an ability to manipulate, or control, just as much as to understand or sympathise. And many prefer not to exercise their imaginations at all. They choose to remain comfortably within the bounds of their own experience, never troubling to wonder how it would feel to have been born other than they are. They can refuse to hear screams or to peer inside cages; they can close their minds and hearts to any suffering that does not touch them personally; they can refuse to know.",73.08,70-75
85,The Benefits Of Failure,85_20,"I might be tempted to envy people who can live that way, except that I do not think they have any fewer nightmares than I do. Choosing to live in narrow spaces leads to a form of mental agoraphobia, and that brings its own terrors. I think the wilfully unimaginative see more monsters. They are often more afraid. What is more, those who choose not to empathise enable real monsters.",76.92,75-80
85,The Benefits Of Failure,85_21,"For without ever committing an act of outright evil ourselves, we collude with it, through our own apathy. One of the many things I learned at the end of that Classics corridor down which I ventured at the age of 18, in search of something I could not then define, was this, written by the Greek author Plutarch: What we achieve inwardly will change outer reality. That is an astonishing statement and yet proven a thousand times every day of our lives. It expresses, in part, our inescapable connection with the outside world, the fact that we touch other people's lives simply by existing. But how much more are you, Harvard graduates of 2008, likely to touch other people's lives?",80.77,80-85
85,The Benefits Of Failure,85_22,"Your intelligence, your capacity for hard work, the education you have earned and received, give you unique status, and unique responsibilities. Even your nationality sets you apart. The great majority of you belong to the world's only remaining superpower.

That is your privilege, and your burden.",84.62,80-85

We do not need magic to change the world, we carry all the power we need inside ourselves already: we have the power to imagine better. I am nearly finished. I have one last hope for you, which is something that I already had at 21. The friends with whom I sat on graduation day have been my friends for life.",88.46,85-90

At our graduation we were bound by enormous affection, by our shared experience of a time that could never come again, and, of course, by the knowledge that we held certain photographic evidence that would be exceptionally valuable if any of us ran for Prime Minister. So today, I wish you nothing better than similar friendships. And tomorrow, I hope that even if you remember not a single word of mine, you remember those of Seneca, another of those old Romans I met when I fled down the Classics corridor, in retreat from career ladders, in search of ancient wisdom: As is a tale, so is life: not how long it is, but how good it is, is what matters.

87,Change the World,87_1,"I remember I had a serious girlfriend, whom I later married — that's important to remember by the way — and I remember that I was getting commissioned in the Navy that day. But of all the things I remember, I don't have a clue who the commencement speaker was that evening, and I certainly don't remember anything they said. So, acknowledging that fact, if I can't make this commencement speech memorable, I will at least try to make it short. The University's slogan is, ""What starts here changes the world."" I have to admit — I kinda like it.",2.7,0-5
87,Change the World,87_2,"""What starts here changes the world."" Tonight there are almost 8,000 students graduating from UT. That great paragon of analytical rigor, Ask.Com, says that the average American will meet 10,000 people in their lifetime. That's a lot of folks. But, if every one of you changed the lives of just 10 people — and each one of those folks changed the lives of another 10 people — just 10 — then in five generations — 125 years — the class of 2014 will have changed the lives of 800 million people.",5.41,5-10
87,Change the World,87_3,800 million people — think of it — over twice the population of the United States. Go one more generation and you can change the entire population of the world — eight billion people. If you think it's hard to change the lives of 10 people — change their lives forever — you're wrong. I saw it happen every day in Iraq and Afghanistan: A young Army officer makes a decision to go left instead of right down a road in Baghdad and the 10 soldiers in his squad are saved from close-in ambush.,8.11,5-10
87,Change the World,87_4,"In Kandahar province, Afghanistan, a non-commissioned officer from the Female Engagement Team senses something isn't right and directs the infantry platoon away from a 500-pound IED, saving the lives of a dozen soldiers. But, if you think about it, not only were these soldiers saved by the decisions of one person, but their children yet unborn were also saved. And their children's children were saved. Generations were saved by one decision, by one person. But changing the world can happen anywhere and anyone can do it.",10.81,10-15
87,Change the World,87_5,"So, what starts here can indeed change the world, but the question is — what will the world look like after you change it? Well, I am confident that it will look much, much better. But if you will humor this old sailor for just a moment, I have a few suggestions that may help you on your way to a better a world. And while these lessons were learned during my time in the military, I can assure you that it matters not whether you ever served a day in uniform. It matters not your gender, your ethnic or religious background, your orientation or your social status.",13.51,10-15
87,Change the World,87_6,"Our struggles in this world are similar, and the lessons to overcome those struggles and to move forward — changing ourselves and the world around us — will apply equally to all. I have been a Navy SEAL for 36 years. But it all began when I left UT for Basic SEAL training in Coronado, California. Basic SEAL training is six months of long torturous runs in the soft sand, midnight swims in the cold water off San Diego, obstacles courses, unending calisthenics, days without sleep and always being cold, wet and miserable. It is six months of being constantly harrassed by professionally trained warriors who seek to find the weak of mind and body and eliminate them from ever becoming a Navy SEAL.",16.22,15-20
87,Change the World,87_7,"But, the training also seeks to find those students who can lead in an environment of constant stress, chaos, failure and hardships. To me basic SEAL training was a lifetime of challenges crammed into six months. So, here are the 10 lessons I learned from basic SEAL training that hopefully will be of value to you as you move forward in life. Every morning in basic SEAL training, my instructors, who at the time were all Vietnam veterans, would show up in my barracks room and the first thing they would inspect was your bed. If you did it right, the corners would be square, the covers pulled tight, the pillow centered just under the headboard and the extra blanket folded neatly at the foot of the rack — that's Navy talk for bed.",18.92,15-20
87,Change the World,87_8,"It was a simple task — mundane at best. But every morning we were required to make our bed to perfection. It seemed a little ridiculous at the time, particularly in light of the fact that were aspiring to be real warriors, tough battle-hardened SEALs, but the wisdom of this simple act has been proven to me many times over. If you make your bed every morning you will have accomplished the first task of the day. It will give you a small sense of pride, and it will encourage you to do another task and another and another.",21.62,20-25
87,Change the World,87_9,"By the end of the day, that one task completed will have turned into many tasks completed. Making your bed will also reinforce the fact that little things in life matter. If you can't do the little things right, you will never do the big things right. And, if by chance you have a miserable day, you will come home to a bed that is made — that you made — and a made bed gives you encouragement that tomorrow will be better. If you want to change the world, start off by making your bed.",24.32,20-25
87,Change the World,87_10,"During SEAL training the students are broken down into boat crews. Each crew is seven students — three on each side of a small rubber boat and one coxswain to help guide the dingy. Every day your boat crew forms up on the beach and is instructed to get through the surfzone and paddle several miles down the coast. In the winter, the surf off San Diego can get to be 8 to 10 feet high and it is exceedingly difficult to paddle through the plunging surf unless everyone digs in. Every paddle must be synchronized to the stroke count of the coxswain.",27.03,25-30
87,Change the World,87_11,"Everyone must exert equal effort or the boat will turn against the wave and be unceremoniously tossed back on the beach. For the boat to make it to its destination, everyone must paddle. You can't change the world alone — you will need some help — and to truly get from your starting point to your destination takes friends, colleagues, the good will of strangers and a strong coxswain to guide them. If you want to change the world, find someone to help you paddle. Over a few weeks of difficult training my SEAL class, which started with 150 men, was down to just 35.",29.73,25-30
87,Change the World,87_12,"There were now six boat crews of seven men each. I was in the boat with the tall guys, but the best boat crew we had was made up of the the little guys — the munchkin crew we called them — no one was over about five-foot-five. The munchkin boat crew had one American Indian, one African American, one Polish American, one Greek American, one Italian American, and two tough kids from the midwest. They out-paddled, out-ran and out-swam all the other boat crews. The big men in the other boat crews would always make good-natured fun of the tiny little flippers the munchkins put on their tiny little feet prior to every swim.",32.43,30-35
87,Change the World,87_13,"But somehow these little guys, from every corner of the nation and the world, always had the last laugh — swimming faster than everyone and reaching the shore long before the rest of us. SEAL training was a great equalizer. Nothing mattered but your will to succeed. Not your color, not your ethnic background, not your education and not your social status. If you want to change the world, measure a person by the size of their heart, not the size of their flippers.",35.14,35-40
87,Change the World,87_14,"Several times a week, the instructors would line up the class and do a uniform inspection. It was exceptionally thorough. Your hat had to be perfectly starched, your uniform immaculately pressed and your belt buckle shiny and void of any smudges. But it seemed that no matter how much effort you put into starching your hat, or pressing your uniform or polishing your belt buckle — it just wasn't good enough. The instructors would find ""something"" wrong.",37.84,35-40
87,Change the World,87_15,"For failing the uniform inspection, the student had to run, fully clothed into the surfzone and then, wet from head to toe, roll around on the beach until every part of your body was covered with sand. The effect was known as a ""sugar cookie."" You stayed in that uniform the rest of the day — cold, wet and sandy. There were many a student who just couldn't accept the fact that all their effort was in vain. That no matter how hard they tried to get the uniform right, it was unappreciated.",40.54,40-45
87,Change the World,87_16,Those students didn't make it through training. Those students didn't understand the purpose of the drill. You were never going to succeed. You were never going to have a perfect uniform. Sometimes no matter how well you prepare or how well you perform you still end up as a sugar cookie.,43.24,40-45
87,Change the World,87_17,"It's just the way life is sometimes. If you want to change the world get over being a sugar cookie and keep moving forward. Every day during training you were challenged with multiple physical events — long runs, long swims, obstacle courses, hours of calisthenics — something designed to test your mettle. Every event had standards — times you had to meet. If you failed to meet those standards your name was posted on a list, and at the end of the day those on the list were invited to a ""circus.""",45.95,45-50
87,Change the World,87_18,"A circus was two hours of additional calisthenics designed to wear you down, to break your spirit, to force you to quit. No one wanted a circus. A circus meant that for that day you didn't measure up. A circus meant more fatigue — and more fatigue meant that the following day would be more difficult — and more circuses were likely. But at some time during SEAL training, everyone — everyone — made the circus list.",48.65,45-50
87,Change the World,87_19,"But an interesting thing happened to those who were constantly on the list. Over time those students — who did two hours of extra calisthenics — got stronger and stronger. The pain of the circuses built inner strength, built physical resiliency. Life is filled with circuses. You will fail.",51.35,50-55
87,Change the World,87_20,"You will likely fail often. It will be painful. It will be discouraging. At times it will test you to your very core. But if you want to change the world, don't be afraid of the circuses.",54.05,50-55
87,Change the World,87_21,"At least twice a week, the trainees were required to run the obstacle course. The obstacle course contained 25 obstacles including a 10-foot high wall, a 30-foot cargo net and a barbed wire crawl, to name a few. But the most challenging obstacle was the slide for life. It had a three-level 30-foot tower at one end and a one-level tower at the other. In between was a 200-foot-long rope.",56.76,55-60
87,Change the World,87_22,"You had to climb the three-tiered tower and once at the top, you grabbed the rope, swung underneath the rope and pulled yourself hand over hand until you got to the other end. The record for the obstacle course had stood for years when my class began training in 1977. The record seemed unbeatable, until one day, a student decided to go down the slide for life head first. Instead of swinging his body underneath the rope and inching his way down, he bravely mounted the TOP of the rope and thrust himself forward. It was a dangerous move — seemingly foolish, and fraught with risk.",59.46,55-60
87,Change the World,87_23,"Failure could mean injury and being dropped from the training. Without hesitation the student slid down the rope perilously fast. Instead of several minutes, it only took him half that time and by the end of the course he had broken the record. If you want to change the world sometimes you have to slide down the obstacle head first. During the land warfare phase of training, the students are flown out to San Clemente Island which lies off the coast of San Diego.",62.16,60-65
87,Change the World,87_24,"The waters off San Clemente are a breeding ground for the great white sharks. To pass SEAL training there are a series of long swims that must be completed. One is the night swim. Before the swim the instructors joyfully brief the trainees on all the species of sharks that inhabit the waters off San Clemente. They assure you, however, that no student has ever been eaten by a shark — at least not recently.",64.86,60-65
87,Change the World,87_25,"But, you are also taught that if a shark begins to circle your position — stand your ground. Do not swim away. Do not act afraid. And if the shark, hungry for a midnight snack, darts towards you — then summon up all your strength and punch him in the snout, and he will turn and swim away. There are a lot of sharks in the world.",67.57,65-70
87,Change the World,87_26,"If you hope to complete the swim you will have to deal with them. So, if you want to change the world, don't back down from the sharks. As Navy SEALs one of our jobs is to conduct underwater attacks against enemy shipping. We practiced this technique extensively during basic training. The ship attack mission is where a pair of SEAL divers is dropped off outside an enemy harbor and then swims well over two miles — underwater — using nothing but a depth gauge and a compass to get to their target.",70.27,70-75
87,Change the World,87_27,"During the entire swim, even well below the surface, there is some light that comes through. It is comforting to know that there is open water above you. But as you approach the ship, which is tied to a pier, the light begins to fade. The steel structure of the ship blocks the moonlight, it blocks the surrounding street lamps, it blocks all ambient light. To be successful in your mission, you have to swim under the ship and find the keel — the centerline and the deepest part of the ship.",72.97,70-75
87,Change the World,87_28,"This is your objective. But the keel is also the darkest part of the ship — where you cannot see your hand in front of your face, where the noise from the ship's machinery is deafening and where it is easy to get disoriented and fail. Every SEAL knows that under the keel, at the darkest moment of the mission, is the time when you must be calm, composed — when all your tactical skills, your physical power and all your inner strength must be brought to bear. If you want to change the world, you must be your very best in the darkest moment. The ninth week of training is referred to as ""Hell Week.""",75.68,75-80

The Mud Flats are area between San Diego and Tijuana where the water runs off and creates the Tijuana slues, a swampy patch of terrain where the mud will engulf you. It is on Wednesday of Hell Week that you paddle down to the mud flats and spend the next 15 hours trying to survive the freezing cold mud, the howling wind and the incessant pressure to quit from the instructors. As the sun began to set that Wednesday evening, my training class, having committed some ""egregious infraction of the rules"" was ordered into the mud. The mud consumed each man till there was nothing visible but our heads.",78.38,75-80
87,Change the World,87_30,"The instructors told us we could leave the mud if only five men would quit — just five men — and we could get out of the oppressive cold. Looking around the mud flat it was apparent that some students were about to give up. It was still over eight hours till the sun came up — eight more hours of bone-chilling cold. The chattering teeth and shivering moans of the trainees were so loud it was hard to hear anything. And then, one voice began to echo through the night, one voice raised in song.",81.08,80-85
87,Change the World,87_31,"The song was terribly out of tune, but sung with great enthusiasm. One voice became two and two became three and before long everyone in the class was singing. We knew that if one man could rise above the misery then others could as well. The instructors threatened us with more time in the mud if we kept up the singingbut the singing persisted. And somehow the mud seemed a little warmer, the wind a little tamer and the dawn not so far away.",83.78,80-85

For old economy companies like ours, which had prospered under a protectionist regime and had forgotten really how to compete, the opening up of the Indian economy was like the grim reaper knocking at the door. And seriously, there were people around, large consultancy firms who were busy writing our epitaph. And yet, three decades later, here we are, a multi-billion dollar group, still chugging along and earning goodwill while we do so.",50.0,50-55
89,Purpose in Life,89_14,"So how did we do it? Well, obviously, there were many ingredients, but to my mind, the most important one was to harness the power of purpose. We found ourselves in a very strange back to the future kind of situation, where once again, we had to prove that we as an Indian company could do it, that we could not just survive, but thrive in the changed economic landscape. And drawing upon an Indian narrative and upon our corporate history, we first elucidated a core purpose that would galvanize people to come to work in the morning and give off their best. Now, that core purpose was simply to say, Indians are second to none, and we will make products that will prove that to the world.",53.85,50-55
89,Purpose in Life,89_15,"I know that sounds terribly parochial, but please understand, at that time, it was a cry to shed the most invisible, pernicious, and lingering feelings of inferiority and a lack of self-belief, which was the bequest of colonialism. And that really had an electrifying effect on our people. It triggered the David versus Goliath sentiment. It tapped into our collective memories of our founding days, where we had succeeded against all odds because we had something to prove. And it fueled our self-belief.",57.69,55-60
89,Purpose in Life,89_16,"I know that sounds warm and fuzzy, but it contributed to concrete results. Between 2002 and 2013, our profits went up 33 times. Our stock price went up 72 times. Now, that took a lot of hard work, but that hard work came about because people were motivated by a sense of purpose. Today, our core purpose has changed.",61.54,60-65
89,Purpose in Life,89_17,"We recognize that as we became transnational, we needed a more global and a more inclusive rallying cry. Now, our purpose, our core purpose is almost as compact. It is to drive positive change in the lives of our communities to enable them to rise. And we often encapsulate that in just the one single word, rise. Now, how that credo precisely evolved is a longer story, but let me tell you that if you asked any one of our 250,000 strong global family what it is that differentiates our company, what it is that gets them to come into work every day, they will say it's our purpose.",65.38,65-70
89,Purpose in Life,89_18,"There's extraordinary alignment around that credo. And I want to underscore the fact that we adapted our purpose to new realities. I believe it's important to accept that purpose can evolve and it can transform, because many of the problems of the world that I alluded to earlier simply arose out of rigid and immutable mindsets. Now, I'm a hard-headed businessman, not an armchair philosopher, but personal experience has taught me never to underestimate the power of purpose in business or in life. And there's no shortage of role models, but I'm not talking about larger-than-life cliched icons.",69.23,65-70
89,Purpose in Life,89_19,"And even before you set out to change the world, which Fletcher no doubt has prepared you to do, I urge you all to take small steps to change the world around you. Perhaps your purpose, like Mahendra's, will also evolve over the course of your life. But one of the privileges of attending an institution like this is the opportunity to step outside the familiarity of your lived experiences, make sense of the bigger picture and of the space that you occupy within it. I myself am inspired almost every single day by people who possess this understanding, who are committed every day to living with empathy, and possibly without ever knowing how impactful they have been. So let me share with you one more personal story.",73.08,70-75
89,Purpose in Life,89_20,"Decades ago, we were in a taxi, rushing to get my then one-year-old daughter to surgery for a hand injury that she had suffered. And my wife and I were beside ourselves with anxiety, my daughter was throwing a tantrum, and the taxi driver clearly picked up on our anxious, intense state. ""May I share an old saying with you?"" he quietly asked us. And he said, ""If everyone's problems were like laundry hanging out to dry in an open field, and you had the opportunity to go out into that field and exchange your laundry, your problems, in other words, with anyone else's, you would still choose your own problems.""",76.92,75-80
89,Purpose in Life,89_21,"And he paused and he just said quietly, ""'Don't worry, I'll get you there safe and sound and in time."" And at that moment, it was precisely the perspective that I needed. The surgery was a success, and to this day, I look gratefully to that cab driver's wise act of comfort, a man who has no idea that he provided me with a view and a resilience that has helped me throughout my career to deal with the rollercoaster ride of business fortunes. You will similarly have no difficulty in finding such inspirational people. You may look around this room and recognize a fellow student who stayed up with you all night to support you when life seemed overwhelming, a professor who postponed an exam when COVID anxiety was at its peak, parents who have worked tirelessly and sacrificed much to enable you to celebrate today.",80.77,80-85
89,Purpose in Life,89_22,"These are people who commit themselves to helping others rise in small but meaningful ways every single day, people who have come to understand the significance of empathy. They find ways to shape their world into what it ought to be. And I ask you, why can't the next individual who brings the is closer to the ought be you? So in closing, let me come back to my father. And I've often asked myself, why did he come to Fletcher?",84.62,80-85
89,Purpose in Life,89_23,"He had already been away from his family and home for four years as an undergraduate at Harvard. Why didn't he simply choose to go home after such a long absence? And if I were to guess what went through his mind, I would say he stayed on because he saw a new world in the making. He wanted to understand that world and he wanted to be part of the solution. He came as the original pilgrim, seeking answers.",88.46,85-90
89,Purpose in Life,89_24,"In a way, so are you all, pilgrims, in search of answers. All pilgrims in search of a better world. I once read the perfect definition of a pilgrim, which says that a pilgrim is a wanderer with a purpose. And I think that pretty much sums up your present and your future. You are all pilgrims who in the course of your careers will wander through an uncharted world.",92.31,90-95

As a boy from the small city of Ilsan in Korea, as a young man standing at the UNGA, as a global citizen of this world, I imagine the limitless possibilities before all of us, and my heart beating with excitement.

90,75th UN General Assembly Speech,90_7,"But you made it. Today, we might not have flowers and we might not have graduation caps. What we do have is possibly the most special graduation ceremony in history. Never before have so many gathered to celebrate a graduating class for their achievements and their dreams. You could be watching us from your bed or from your living room alone or with somebody.",26.92,25-30
90,75th UN General Assembly Speech,90_8,"Wherever you are, you will also be breaking out of one world, soar into another. Ten years ago, it snowed really hard on the day of my middle school graduation. I remember that day clearly because I took a picture with my friends and kept it as my messenger profile for the rest of my school years. On that day, I was just a boy who had closed just one chapter ready to pen another. And I remember that feeling.",30.77,30-35
90,75th UN General Assembly Speech,90_9,"It's really thrilling, breathtaking. It was a moment I felt most like me myself, a feeling I wanted to hold on to forever.

Dear class of 2020, I hope our stories reached you all today.",34.62,30-35
90,75th UN General Assembly Speech,90_10,"To be really, really frank, we still feel very unsure and unsettled as we speak. Just like that day, we left the school gates for the last time on graduation day. Some say we have achieved so many things, but we stand no different from any other youth in their twenties. Our graduation caps still pressed to our heads and awkwardly peering into the face of reality. The recent unforeseen events completely changed our plans and the sense of loss and anxiety we felt then are still with us today.",38.46,35-40
90,75th UN General Assembly Speech,90_11,"The fear of an obscure future as our daily lives turned upside down is a moment of realization of the self, the realization of what makes me a true me, myself.

And it connects to the world during such difficult times and with music, we hope we can bring you smiles and courage again. And V just mentioned memos and the photographs.",42.31,40-45

And our fans have become a major part of this campaign with their action and with their enthusiasm, we truly have the best fans in the world. And I'd like to begin by talking about myself. I was born in Ilsan, a city near Seoul, South Korea.",53.85,50-55
90,75th UN General Assembly Speech,90_15,"It is a really beautiful place with a lake, hills, and even an annual flower festival. I spent a very happy childhood there and I was just an ordinary boy. I used to look up at the night sky wonder, and I used to dream the dreams of a boy. I used to imagine that I was a superhero who could save the world.",57.69,55-60
90,75th UN General Assembly Speech,90_16,"And in an intro to one of our early albums, there is a line that says, ""my heart stopped when I was maybe nine or ten."" Looking back, I think that's when I began to worry about what other people thought of me and starting seeing myself through their eyes. I stopped looking up at the night skies, the stars. I stopped daydreaming. Instead, I just tried to jam myself into the molds that other people made.",61.54,60-65
90,75th UN General Assembly Speech,90_17,"Soon I began to shut out my own voice and started to listen to the voices of others. No one called out my name, and neither did I. My heart stopped and my eyes closed shut. So like this, I, we, all lost our names. We became like ghosts.",65.38,65-70
90,75th UN General Assembly Speech,90_18,"But I had one thing and that was music. There was a small voice inside of me that said, ""Wake up, man, and listen to yourself."" But it took me quite a long time to hear music calling my real name. Even after making the decision to join BTS, there were a lot of hurdles. Some people might not believe, but most people thought we were hopeless.",69.23,65-70
90,75th UN General Assembly Speech,90_19,And sometimes I just wanted to quit. But I think I was very lucky that I didn't give it all up. And I'm sure that I and we will keep stumbling and falling like this. BTS has become artists performing in those huge stadiums and selling millions of albums right now.

Today, I am who I am with all of my faults and my mistakes.",76.92,75-80
90,75th UN General Assembly Speech,90_21,"Tomorrow, I might be a tiny bit wiser, and that would be me, too. These faults and mistakes are what I am making up the brightest stars in the constellation of my life. I have come to lock myself for who I am, for who I was and for who I hope to become. I'd like to say the one last thing. After releasing our ""Love Yourself"" albums and launching the Love Myself campaign, we started to hear remarkable stories from our fans all over the world, how our message helped them overcome the hardships in life and start loving themselves.",80.77,80-85
90,75th UN General Assembly Speech,90_22,"Those stories constantly remind us of our responsibility. So let's take all one more step. We have learned to love ourselves. So now I urge you to speak yourself. I'd like to ask all of you, what is your name?",84.62,80-85

She's an amazing doctor, but at the same time, she's never made me feel like she didn't have the time for me, or she's always been there for me as a mother.

92,Women’s Empowerment,92_14,"And I chose to educate myself at a college, which is a girl's college in rural Haryana because I believed something that my father told me that if you go to the remotest of places, as a doctor, you will learn the most. And I wanted to learn. But when I went to my college, it was completely different from what I had imagined. And that's when as an 18-year-old, I had an idea to do something when it came to menstruation. Because at that point of time, all I understood was health.",50.0,50-55
92,Women’s Empowerment,92_15,"And I felt that well, menstruation, if women are more comfortable about menstruation and, you know, we are able to take care of their hygiene, then definitely it won't boil down to diseases such as pelvic inflammatory diseases and your RTIs, and that could, RTI, reproductive tract infection, not the RTI you guys know. So, that's how I started my project. And so, in the local areas, they started calling it as Shakti when I would go. Because I mean, Shakti, you all know that every woman is considered as a form of Shakti and Shakti means power and to empower. And that's how more than just a health project, it became an empowerment project for me.",53.57,50-55
92,Women’s Empowerment,92_16,I showed the project to the Miss India team. They really liked it. It wasn't a project at that time. It was just an idea. I was doing awareness programs with the help of my parents.,57.14,55-60
92,Women’s Empowerment,92_17,"But after winning Miss India, you have something called as 'Beauty with a Purpose' at Miss World. Beauty with a Purpose is the vision and mission of Miss World. That's what Miss World stands for. It gives young girls, like me, not just me, but all 130 countries that represent at Miss World, an opportunity to bring a change in their country or in their communities. And well, Miss India wanted to work on my project.",60.71,60-65
92,Women’s Empowerment,92_18,"So, I worked across three states in North India, more than 20 village communities and we created women entrepreneurs back in. So, we encouraged women from the village to source sanitary pads from the Walmart. So, I collaborated with Walmart India and a local manufacturer of sanitary pads. And so, these women would purchase low-cost sanitary pads and sell them in their village because more than the lack of awareness and the high cost of sanitary pads which women felt, it was the taboo that was associated with it. And women would feel uncomfortable to buy sanitary pads from mostly a man who's a shopkeeper.",64.29,60-65
92,Women’s Empowerment,92_19,"So, that's how that was my short-term project. I remember being shortlisted as a semi-finalist for Beauty with a Purpose at Miss World, which is the biggest award when you go from a Miss World competition. And I was looking at my project. Three and a half months, I travelled across those states. It wasn't easy to go to these places.",67.86,65-70
92,Women’s Empowerment,92_20,"I went to a village where children didn't even have clothes to wear. So, I could imagine that if they can't afford proper clothes, how can they afford sanitary pads? I mean, that's the kind of mentality that they have over there. And as a 20-year-old to see so much, it just makes you want to do so much more because I'm still growing. I'm still learning.",71.43,70-75
92,Women’s Empowerment,92_21,"I'm still in that stage where I'm figuring out what I truly want to do in life. And that's when I found my purpose. And in the top 20, there were amazing projects.

92,Women’s Empowerment,92_22,"And I won Beauty with a Purpose. And I'm very proud to say that… And I'm very proud to say that I'm the first Miss World who also won Beauty with a Purpose. After which of course, not only my project, after winning Miss World, we were here in India. This year's Beauty with a Purpose too is started my home country from my project where we travelled for nine days.",78.57,75-80
92,Women’s Empowerment,92_23,"Not only me and the Miss World team, but we had continental winners. We had young girls, so they aren't politicians. They aren't powerful people, but they are just young girls just like me. They are students, they are daughters, one of them is still in school. And they all came down and we all were travelling across India, trying to spread awareness, trying to create different systems.",82.14,80-85
92,Women’s Empowerment,92_24,"We met with people called as Akar Innovations. Most of you must be knowing about them. And we met these tribal communities at the Bhutan border. We travelled a lot, but we met up with politicians, the honourable vice-president and our external affairs minister. They were kind enough to meet us and support us on our project, after which I travelled to different countries.",85.71,85-90
92,Women’s Empowerment,92_25,"I can go on and on about that, but these are young women who are doing this. They are young women who are bringing this change and that in itself makes us feel so empowered. I think a lot of people ask me this question that, how did you prepare for Miss World? When did you start preparing for Miss World? And I have no answer to it.",89.29,85-90
92,Women’s Empowerment,92_26,"And when I think about it, I think it's 20 years. And I know I speak like a 30-year-old and I think like a six-year-old, but I'm 20 years old, believe me on that. And I think it's 20 years of being a woman who never treated herself differently, just because she was a girl growing up in a family where she didn't know the meaning of the words, women empowerment because she never felt she needed it. And I think I was fortunate.",92.86,90-95
92,Women’s Empowerment,92_27,"And all I can say is that I pray that in the future, no one knows the meaning of women's empowerment because we don't need these words. Women are equal to men. Thank you.",96.43,95-100

If there is anyone out there who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible, who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time, who still questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer. It's the answer told by lines that stretched around schools and churches in numbers this nation has never seen, by people who waited three hours and four hours, many for the first time in their lives, because they believed that this time must be different, that their voices could be that difference. It's the answer spoken by young and old, rich and poor, Democrat and Republican, black, white, Hispanic, Asian, Native American, gay, straight, disabled and not disabled.

It's been a long time coming, but tonight, because of what we did on this date in this election at this defining moment change has come to America. We didn't start with much money or many endorsements. Our campaign was not hatched in the halls of Washington.",5.88,5-10
93,Yes We Can,93_2,"It began in the backyards of Des Moines and the living rooms of Concord and the front porches of Charleston. It was built by working men and women who dug into what little savings they had to give $5 and $10 and $20 to the cause. It grew strength from the young people who rejected the myth of their generation's apathy who left their homes and their families for jobs that offered little pay and less sleep. It drew strength from the not-so-young people who braved the bitter cold and scorching heat to knock on doors of perfect strangers, and from the millions of Americans who volunteered and organized and proved that more than two centuries later a government of the people, by the people, and for the people has not perished from the Earth. This is your victory.",11.76,10-15
93,Yes We Can,93_3,"And I know you didn't do this just to win an election. And I know you didn't do it for me. You did it because you understand the enormity of the task that lies ahead. For even as we celebrate tonight, we know the challenges that tomorrow will bring are the greatest of our lifetime — two wars, a planet in peril, the worst financial crisis in a century. Even as we stand here tonight, we know there are brave Americans waking up in the deserts of Iraq and the mountains of Afghanistan to risk their lives for us.",17.65,15-20
93,Yes We Can,93_4,"There are mothers and fathers who will lie awake after the children fall asleep and wonder how they'll make the mortgage or pay their doctors' bills or save enough for their child's college education.

We may not get there in one year or even in one term.",23.53,20-25
93,Yes We Can,93_5,"But, America, I have never been more hopeful than I am tonight that we will get there. I promise you, we as a people will get there. There will be setbacks and false starts.

93,Yes We Can,93_6,"But I will always be honest with you about the challenges we face. I will listen to you, especially when we disagree. And, above all, I will ask you to join in the work of remaking this nation, the only way it's been done in America for 221 years — block by block, brick by brick, calloused hand by calloused hand. What began 21 months ago in the depths of winter cannot end on this autumn night. This victory alone is not the change we seek.",35.29,35-40
93,Yes We Can,93_7,"It is only the chance for us to make that change. And that cannot happen if we go back to the way things were. It can't happen without you, without a new spirit of service, a new spirit of sacrifice. So let us summon a new spirit of patriotism, of responsibility, where each of us resolves to pitch in and work harder and look after not only ourselves but each other.

93,Yes We Can,93_8,"In this country, we rise or fall as one nation, as one people. Let's resist the temptation to fall back on the same partisanship and pettiness and immaturity that has poisoned our politics for so long. Let's remember that it was a man from this state who first carried the banner of the Republican Party to the White House, a party founded on the values of self-reliance and individual liberty and national unity. Those are values that we all share.

To those — to those who would tear the world down: We will defeat you. To those who seek peace and security: We support you. And to all those who have wondered if America's beacon still burns as bright: Tonight we proved once more that the true strength of our nation comes not from the might of our arms or the scale of our wealth, but from the enduring power of our ideals: democracy, liberty, opportunity and unyielding hope. That's the true genius of America: that America can change.",58.82,55-60

She's a lot like the millions of others who stood in line to make their voice heard in this election except for one thing: Ann Nixon Cooper is 106 years old.,64.71,60-65
93,Yes We Can,93_12,"She was born just a generation past slavery; a time when there were no cars on the road or planes in the sky; when someone like her couldn't vote for two reasons — because she was a woman and because of the color of her skin. And tonight, I think about all that she's seen throughout her century in America — the heartache and the hope; the struggle and the progress; the times we were told that we can't, and the people who pressed on with that American creed: Yes we can. At a time when women's voices were silenced and their hopes dismissed, she lived to see them stand up and speak out and reach for the ballot. Yes we can. When there was despair in the dust bowl and depression across the land, she saw a nation conquer fear itself with a New Deal, new jobs, a new sense of common purpose.",70.59,70-75
93,Yes We Can,93_13,"Yes we can. When the bombs fell on our harbor and tyranny threatened the world, she was there to witness a generation rise to greatness and a democracy was saved. Yes we can.

Yes we can. America, we have come so far. We have seen so much.",82.35,80-85

If youth of today, if you decide, someone who is about 15 to 16 to up to 30, if they decide not to drink certain types of soft drinks, the market of that soft drink will plummet. If you decide that you are not entertained by certain types of entertainment, if you feel going to the movie theaters and watching movies does not give you entertainment, the movie business will go down.

Now what happens is when someone else is directing you of all these things, the society becomes a one big herd. There's a danger of creating a herd, a sheep-like community where everybody thinks alike, where everybody wants to wear the same thing, where everybody wants to have something that the other person has, and they do not make their own individual decision.

So this is what I really want to tell the youth of today is reclaim that power that you guys have, your individuality, your personality, you know, the thing that you're capable of your own own, because now I see you here, you know, gathered, I can either look at you as a bunch of students, or I can look at you as individuals. If I look at you as a bunch of students, I will just see similar things, similarities, same age, same reaction, same kind of thought process, but if I look at you individually, each of you have something to offer. Each of you have certain types of skills and talents that you can bring into the table, and you should be recognizing that, and you should be utilizing that, because I'm not saying that all of you are equal, but what I'm saying is each one of you are different, and cash on that, utilize that.

You're probably saying that I want to excel in this, I wanna become this, I wanna become a great banker maybe, I wanna become a great CEO in the future maybe, and you make a certain goals for yourself.

So we bump up against a common trope I think of the commencement address people who have achieved a lot telling you that the fruits of the achievement are not always to be trusted.

I was known mainly at school for having a backpack bigger than I was and always having white-out on my hands because I hated seeing anything crossed out in my note books. I was voted for my senior yearbook ""most likely to be a contestant on Jeopardy"" or code for nerdiest. When I got to Harvard just after the release of Star Wars: Episode 1, I knew I would be staring over in terms of how people viewed me.

I was alarmed and intimidated by the calm eyes of a fellow student who came here from Dalton or Exeter, who thought that compared to high school the workload here was easy.

Their names, for the record, were Bernie Sanders, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, Barack Obama, Hilary Clinton. In all seriousness, I believed every one of them. Their bearing and self-confidence alone seemed the proof of their prophecy where I couldn't shake my self-doubt. I got in only because I was famous.",30.23,30-35

Driven by these insecurities, I decided I was going to find something to do in Harvard that was serious and meaningful, that would change the world and make it a better place. At the age of 18, I'd already been acting for 7 years, and assumed I find a more serious and profound path in college. So freshman fall I decided to take Neurobiology and Advanced Modern Hebrew Literature because I was serious and intellectual. Needless to say, I should have failed both.",32.56,30-35

But as I was fighting my way through Aleph Bet Yod Y'shua in Hebrew and the different mechanisms of neuro-response, I saw friends around me writing papers on sailing and pop culture magazines, and professors teaching classes on fairy tales and The Matrix. I realized that seriousness for seriousness's sake was its own kind of trophy, and a dubious one, a pose I sought to counter some half-imagined argument about who I was. There was a reason that I was an actor. I love what I do.",34.88,30-35
97,Don’t Doubt Yourself,97_16,"And I saw from my peers and my mentors that it was not only an acceptable reason, it was the best reason. When I got to my graduation, siting where you sit today after 4 years of trying to get excited about something else, I admitted to myself that I couldn't wait to go back and make more films. I wanted to tell stories, to imagine the lives of others and help others do the same. I have found or perhaps reclaimed my reason. You have a prize now or at least you will tomorrow.",37.21,35-40
97,Don’t Doubt Yourself,97_17,"The prize is Harvard degree in your hand. But what is your reason behind it? My Harvard degree represents, for me, the curiosity and invention that were encouraged here, the friendships I've sustained, the way Professor Graham told me not to describe the way light hit a flower but rather the shadow the flower cast, the way Professor Scarry talked about theatre is a transformative religious force, how professor Coslin showed how much our visual cortex is activated just by imaging. Now granted these things don't necessarily help me answer the most common question I'm asked: What designer are you wearing? What's your fitness regime?",39.53,35-40
97,Don’t Doubt Yourself,97_18,"Any makeup tips? But I have never since been embarrassed to myself as what I might previously have thought was a stupid question.

Some combination of being 19, dealing with my first heartbreak, taking birth control pills that have since been taken off the market for their depressive side effects, and spending too much time missing daylight during winter mouths led me to some pretty dark moments, particularly during sophomore year. There were several occasions where I started crying in meetings with professors, overwhelmed with what I was supposed to pull off when I could barely get myself out of bed in the morning, moments when I took on the motto for school work. ""Done. Not good.""",46.51,45-50
97,Don’t Doubt Yourself,97_21,"If only I could finish my work, even if it took eating a jumbo pack of sour Patch Kids to get me through a single 10-page paper. I felt that I'd accomplished a great feat. I repeat to myself. ""Done. Not good.""",48.84,45-50
97,Don’t Doubt Yourself,97_22,"A couple of years ago, I went to Tokyo with my husband and I ate at the most remarkable sushi restaurant. I don't even eat fish. I'm vegan. So that tells you how good it was. Even with just vegetables, this sushi was the stuff you dreamed about.",51.16,50-55
97,Don’t Doubt Yourself,97_23,"The restaurant has six seats. My husband and I marveled at how anyone can make rice so superior to all other rice. We wondered why they didn't make a bigger restaurant and be the most popular place in town. Our local friend explained to us that all the best restaurants in Tokyo are that small and do only one type of dish: sushi or tempura or teriyaki, because they want to do that thing well and beautifully. And it's not about quantity.",53.49,50-55
97,Don’t Doubt Yourself,97_24,"It's about taking pleasure in the perfection and beauty of the particular. I'm still learning now that it's about good and maybe never done. And the joy and work ethic and virtuosity we bring to the particular can impart a singular type of enjoyment to those we give to and of course, ourselves. In my professional life, it also took me time to find my own reasons for doing my work. The first film I was in came out in 1994.",55.81,55-60
97,Don’t Doubt Yourself,97_25,"Again, appallingly, the year most of you were born. I was 13 years old upon the film's release and I can still quote what the New York Times said about me verbatim. ""Ms. Portman poses better than she acts."" The film had universally tepid critic response and went on to bomb commercially. That film was called The Professional, or Leon in Europe.",58.14,55-60
97,Don’t Doubt Yourself,97_26,"And today, 20 years and 35 films later, it is still the film people approach me about the most to tell me how much they loved it, how much it moved them, how it's their favorite movie. I feel lucky that my first experience of releasing a film was initially such a disaster by all standards and measures. I learned early that my meaning had to be from the experience of making a film and the possibility of connecting with individuals rather than the foremost trophies in my industry: financial and critical success. And also these initial reactions could be false predictors of your work's ultimate legacy. I started choosing only jobs that I'm passionate about and from which I knew I could glean meaningful experiences.",60.47,60-65
97,Don’t Doubt Yourself,97_27,"This thoroughly confused everyone around me: agents, producers, and audiences alike. I made Gotya's Ghost, a foreign independent film and study our history visiting the Prado everyday for 4 months as I read about Goya and the Spanish Inquisition. I made V for Vendetta, studio action movie for which I learned everything I could about freedom fighters whom otherwise may be called terrorists. From Menachem Begin to Weather Underground, I made Your Highness, a pothead comedy with Danny McBride and laughed for 3 months straight. I was able to own my meaning and not have it be determined by box office receipts or prestige.",62.79,60-65
97,Don’t Doubt Yourself,97_28,"By the time I got to making Black Swan, the experience was entirely my own. I felt immune to the worst things anyone could say or write about me, and to whether an audience felt like going to see my movie or not. It was instructive for me to see, for ballet dancers once your technique gets to a certain level, the only thing that separates you from others is your quirks or even flaws. One ballerina was famous for how she turned slightly off balanced. You can never be the best, technically.",65.12,65-70
97,Don’t Doubt Yourself,97_29,"Someone will always have a higher jump or a more beautiful line. The only thing you can be the best at is developing your own self. Authoring your own experience was very much what Black Swan itself was about. I worked with Darren Aronofsky, the film's director, who changed my last line in the movie to: it was perfect. My character Nina is only artistically successful when she finds perfection and pleasure for herself not when she was trying to be perfect in the eyes of others.",67.44,65-70
97,Don’t Doubt Yourself,97_30,"So when Black Swan was successful financially and I began receiving accolades, I felt honored and grateful to have connected with people. But the true core of my meaning, I had already established. And I needed it to be independent of people's reactions to me. People told me that Black Swan was an artistic risk, a scary challenge to try to portray a professional ballet dancer. But it didn't feel like courage or daring that drew me to it.",69.77,65-70
97,Don’t Doubt Yourself,97_31,"I was so oblivious to my own limits that I did things I was woefully unprepared to do. And so the very inexperience that in college had made me insecure and made me want to play by other's rules now is making me actually take risks I didn't even realize were risks. When Darren asked me if I could do ballet, I told him I was basically a ballerina which, by the way, I wholeheartedly believed. When it quickly became clear that preparing for film, that I was 15 years away from being a ballerina, it made me work a million times harder and of course the magic of cinema and body doubles helped the final effect. But the point is, if I had known my own limitations, I never would take of the risk.",72.09,70-75
97,Don’t Doubt Yourself,97_32,"And the risk led to one of my greatest artistic personal experiences, and that I not only felt completely free, I also met my husband during the filming. Similarly, I just directed my first film, A Tale of love in Darkness. I was quite blind to the challenges ahead of me. The film is a period film, completely in Hebrew, in which I also act with an eight-year-old child as a co-star. All of these are challenges I should have been terrified of as I was completely unprepared for them, but my complete ignorance to my own limitations looked like confidence and got me into the director's chair.",74.42,70-75
97,Don’t Doubt Yourself,97_33,"Once here, I have to figure it all out, and my belief that I could handle these things, contrary to all evidence of my ability to do so, was only half the battle. The other half was very hard work. The experience was the deepest and most meaningful one of my career. Now clearly I'm not urging you to go and perform heart surgery without the knowledge to do so! Making movies admittedly has less drastic consequences than most professions and allows for a lot of effects that make up for mistakes.",76.74,75-80
97,Don’t Doubt Yourself,97_34,"The thing I'm saying is, make use of the fact that you don't doubt yourself too much right now. As we get older, we get more realistic, and that includes about our own abilities or lack thereof, and that realism does us no favors. People always talk about diving into things you're afraid of. That never worked for me. If I am afraid, I run away.",79.07,75-80
97,Don’t Doubt Yourself,97_35,"And I would probably urge my child to do the same. Fear protects us in many ways. What has served me is diving into my own obliviousness, being more confident than I should be, which everyone tends to decry American kids, and those of us who have been grade inflated and ego inflated. Well. It can be a good thing if it makes you try things you never might have tried.",81.4,80-85
97,Don’t Doubt Yourself,97_36,"Your inexperience is an asset, and will allow you to think in original and unconventional way. Accept your lack of knowledge and use it as your asset. I know a famous violinist who told me that he can't compose because he knows too many pieces. So when he starts thinking of a note, an existing piece immediately comes to mind. Just starting out of your biggest strengths is, not knowing how things are supposed to be.",83.72,80-85
97,Don’t Doubt Yourself,97_37,You can compose freely because your mind isn't cluttered with too many pieces. And you don't take for granted the way things are. The only way you know how to do things is your own way. You here will all go on to achieve great things. There is no doubt about that.,86.05,85-90
97,Don’t Doubt Yourself,97_38,"Each time you set out to do something new, your inexperience can either lead you down a path where you will conform to someone else's values or you can forge your own path, even though you don't realize that's what you're doing. If your reasons are your own, your path, even if it's a strange and clumsy path, will be wholly yours, and you will control the rewards of what you do by making your internal life fulfilling. At the risk of sounding like a Miss American Contestant, the most fulfilling things I've experienced have truly been the human interactions: spending time with women in village banks in Mexico with FINCA microfinance organization, meeting young women who were the first and the only in their communities to attend secondary schools in rural Kenya with free the Children group that built sustainable schools in developing countries tracking with gorilla conservationists in Rwanda. It's cliché, because it's true that helping other ends up helping you more than anyone. Getting out of your own concerns and caring about some else's life for a while, remind you that you are not the central of the universe, and that in the ways we're generous or not, we can change course of someone's life.",88.37,85-90
97,Don’t Doubt Yourself,97_39,"Even at work, the small feat of kindness crew members, directors, fellow actors have shown me, have had the most lasting impact. And of course, first and foremost, the center of my world is the love that I share with my family and friends. I wish for you that your friends will be with you through it all as my friends from Harvard have been together since we graduated. My friends from school are still very close. We've nursed each other through heartaches and danced at each other's weddings.",90.7,90-95
97,Don’t Doubt Yourself,97_40,"We've held each other at funerals, and rocked each other's new babies. We've worked together on projects, helped each other get jobs, and thrown parties for when we've quit bad ones. And now our children are creating a second generation of friendship as we look at them toddling together. Haggard and disheveled working parents that we are. Grab the good people around you and don't let them go.",93.02,90-95
97,Don’t Doubt Yourself,97_41,"The biggest asset this school offers you is a group of peers that will both be your family and your school life. I remember always being pissed at the spring here in Cambridge, tricking us into remembering a sunny yard full of laughing Frisbee throwers after 8 months of dark frigid library dwelling. It was like the school had managed to turn on the good weather. As a last memory, we should keep in mind that would make us want to come back. But as I got farther away my years here, I know the power of this school is much deeper than weather control.",95.35,95-100
97,Don’t Doubt Yourself,97_42,It changed the very questions that I was asking. To quote one of my favorite thinkers Abraham Joshua Hechel: To be or not to be is not the question; the vital question is how to be and how not to be. Thank you! I can't wait to see how you do all the beautiful things you will do.,97.67,95-100
98,India's Democratic Walk,98_0,Thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to come and speak to you. I've heard a lot about your institution. I spent some time in one of your competitors. It's an honor for me to be here. I've been asked to speak about global transition and how the world is changing.,0.0,0-5
98,India's Democratic Walk,98_1,And also how one should act through that change. How one should think about acting through the turbulence that is obviously going to come. I heard in the introduction that I was a member of parliament until a few months ago. I don't think when I joined politics in 2004 I ever imagined what I see going on in our country. It was way outside anything that I had ever imagined.,2.56,0-5
98,India's Democratic Walk,98_2,"To be the first person to get a full criminal sentence on defamation, to get the maximum sentence and to be disqualified from parliament. I didn't imagine that something like this was possible. But then I think it's actually given me a huge opportunity. Probably much bigger than the opportunity I would have sitting in parliament. That's just the way politics works.",5.13,5-10
98,India's Democratic Walk,98_3,"I think the drama started really about six months ago. We were struggling. Entire opposition is struggling in India. Huge financial dominance, institutional capture. We were struggling to fight the democratic fight in our country.",7.69,5-10
98,India's Democratic Walk,98_4,And we decided none of the systems were working. Democracy isn't just about an opposition party. It's about a set of institutions that support the opposition party. Those institutions either captured or certainly weren't playing the role that they're supposed to play. So we decided to do something quite strange.,10.26,10-15
98,India's Democratic Walk,98_5,"We just decided to walk across the country. We never imagined for a second what would happen when we walked across the country. What would happen not just politically, not in terms of the type of response we got, but what would happen to us when we walked across our country. All of us. Started with about 125 people.",12.82,10-15
98,India's Democratic Walk,98_6,"And it fundamentally transformed the way we think about our country, about our people, about politics, about what is important. A lot of people ask me, what's the lesson you've learned from this? And for a long time I couldn't quite say what it was. I couldn't answer. I'd say, you know, I've picked up so much information overload, I can't really tell you what this has done.",15.38,15-20
98,India's Democratic Walk,98_7,"It was the most beautiful experience of my life, by far. It was very painful. I had a knee problem. It's one of those things you get up and you say, okay, we're going to walk 4,000 kilometers. Some level, it's a crazy thing to even conceptualize.",17.95,15-20
98,India's Democratic Walk,98_8,"I thought that would be, I'm reasonably fit, I thought it would be, shouldn't be too difficult. I calculated in my mind, I said, well, what's it going to be? It's going to be 25 kilometers a day. No big deal. And then I had a knee problem.",20.51,20-25
98,India's Democratic Walk,98_9,"And then the whole thing, the way life works, everything just transformed itself. We met… what I would best describe as the soul of our country. And very quickly, in a week, 10 days, a silence descended on us. We couldn't speak. We went from trying to explain things to people.",23.08,20-25
98,India's Democratic Walk,98_10,"This is why agriculture isn't working. This is how you should think about education. This is how the health care system should look. This is what we should be doing. And suddenly, we all went silent.",25.64,25-30
98,India's Democratic Walk,98_11,"And we went silent because we came into contact with an intelligence that we had never seen, that we had never even conceptualized could exist. Farmers who you would say, many people would say, don't have an education. And then who are explaining things to us in a way that we just are in stunned silence. And we saw this with farmers, with laborers, with small businessmen, everybody. And so this silence descended on us.",28.21,25-30
98,India's Democratic Walk,98_12,"And we just sort of stopped talking and started listening. And we heard tales of immense suffering. I mean, I can think immediately, I thought about one where, which sort of, to me, embodied the spirit of my country, our country. I was walking and a young man came and started walking with me. And I put my arm on his shoulder.",30.77,30-35
98,India's Democratic Walk,98_13,"And suddenly, I realized he didn't have arms. So he had no arms. And I tried to sort of make him a bit comfortable. I didn't want him to feel that I know you don't have arms. He wasn't too bothered.",33.33,30-35
98,India's Democratic Walk,98_14,"And we started talking. And I asked him, listen, what do you do? And he looked at me and he said, I'm a mechanic. The immediate thing in my mind was, he's lying. How can he be a mechanic?",35.9,35-40
98,India's Democratic Walk,98_15,"He doesn't have arms. It's impossible. So I said, well, I didn't want to be direct. I didn't want to say, you're lying. I said, listen, what cars do you repair?",38.46,35-40
98,India's Democratic Walk,98_16,"He says, I don't repair cars. I repair motorcycles. So I said, oh, yeah? What motorcycle do you repair?",41.03,40-45
98,India's Democratic Walk,98_17,"And he started listing all the motorcycles. So I said, can I come and see what you do? And he said, yeah. And then he proceeded to take us and show us how he serviced a motorcycle with his feet. It's the most amazing thing I've ever seen in my life.",43.59,40-45
98,India's Democratic Walk,98_18,He took apart the entire engine with his feet. And he put the entire engine back together with his feet. I can't do it with my hands. So we saw these type of things happening. And we saw clearly the disconnect between our politics and our people.,46.15,45-50
98,India's Democratic Walk,98_19,And that disconnect is visible in the United States. It's visible in the rest of the world. There's a… huge divide between the people and the politics. Politics is talking about something else. People are talking about something else.,48.72,45-50
98,India's Democratic Walk,98_20,"We experienced this multiple times. And as I was walking through this, I kept thinking something puzzled me. What I couldn't understand is that while we were walking, we had no force. Force was completely on the other side. The other side had police.",51.28,50-55
98,India's Democratic Walk,98_21,They had the institutions. They had the media. They had social media. They had everything. And here was this group of people.,53.85,50-55
98,India's Democratic Walk,98_22,"In a few weeks, it became thousands and then millions just walking. And all the force at the disposal of the government of India could do nothing. And the more they tried to apply force, the less it worked. And so this puzzled me. I was like, how come they have all the force, they have all the systems, and nothing's happening?",56.41,55-60
98,India's Democratic Walk,98_23,"Why, for example, are they just not physically stopping us? And this was a question that just kept rotating in my mind. Why is it that they have the force, but they don't have power? And I realized that force and power are two completely different things. Most people, politicians in particular, confuse force and power.",58.97,55-60
98,India's Democratic Walk,98_24,And they think they're the same thing. They're not the same thing. They're completely different things. Power is an act of imagination. Power is in the present.,61.54,60-65
98,India's Democratic Walk,98_25,It is not linear. And power comes when you go close to the truth. The reason we could not be stopped by force is because we were weaving around near the truth. And what was really interesting to me was it didn't matter how much force the other side had. They simply could not transfer that force into power.,64.1,60-65
98,India's Democratic Walk,98_26,"And they kept saying to us, people will ask us, so when are you going to stop? We're like, we're not going to stop. We're going all the way to Kashmir. No, you're not going to be able to go to Kashmir. They told me in Kashmir that, look, if you walk the last four days, you're going to get killed.",66.67,65-70
98,India's Democratic Walk,98_27,"They're going to throw hand grenades on you. I was like, fine, no problem. Let them do it. I want to see… I want to see the person who throws a hand grenade on me. And the security guys, the people from the establishment there, I could see in their face that they just couldn't understand what I was saying.",69.23,65-70
98,India's Democratic Walk,98_28,"So this distinction in your life, in your work, is very important. It doesn't matter how much force the other person has. You can still have power. And it is determined by how close you are and how precise you are with regards to the truth. Now, you can see these moments.",71.79,70-75
98,India's Democratic Walk,98_29,"Mine was a very small one. You can see these moments of power versus truth in history. Big ones. For example, my leader, Mahatma Gandhi, fought the entire British Empire. He had no force.",74.36,70-75
98,India's Democratic Walk,98_30,"They had all the force, all the structures, the army, everything. Didn't matter. Right? The Declaration of Independence here in the United States, again, a moment of power, a moment of truth. Doesn't matter how much force the other person has.",76.92,75-80
98,India's Democratic Walk,98_31,"So why am I telling you this? Why am I making this distinction between power and force? And what does it have to do with the transition that we're facing? Well, the transition we are facing, there are three transitions. There is a revolution in mobility.",79.49,75-80
98,India's Democratic Walk,98_32,"There is a revolution in the energy system. And there's a revolution in connectivity, what we call AI and data. These are the three revolutions that are taking place. And they're going to affect everything. The last time we had a similar transition, a transition of energy, a transition of mobility, we had two world wars.",82.05,80-85
98,India's Democratic Walk,98_33,"Right? And it's in times like that, of great uncertainty, of turbulence, that you need acts of imagination. While I was coming here to Stanford University, I was thinking about it. All the work that you do, a lot of the work that you do, robotics, AI, where was the moment of power? The moment of power was when President Kennedy said, let's go to the moon.",84.62,80-85
98,India's Democratic Walk,98_34,"Right? That was not an act of force. That was an act of imagination. And from that, a lot of the work you do has emerged, evolved. And that's the type of relationship the United States and India should be thinking about.",87.18,85-90
98,India's Democratic Walk,98_35,A relationship that's based on the true reality of our people. We know in India a lot about the reality of our people. All of you know. You live in our great country. You know the levels of poverty that we have.,89.74,85-90
98,India's Democratic Walk,98_36,"You also know the amazing amount of skills that we have. The United States has the world's cutting edge technology. We already have a bridge between us.

I want to tell you the story of the president who is fighting for you from dawn to midnight, when the cameras have left, the microphones are off, and the decisions really count.

I couldn't believe that so many politicians actually prefer to complain about a problem, rather than fix it. I was shocked to see people leave major challenges unsolved, so they can blame the other side and campaign on the same issue in the next election.

You are the reason he ran for president in the first place. And you are the reason he's going to keep fighting for four more years. I remember one evening in early February of 2018. We were in the Oval Office, with my father's top economic advisors, and the president was pushing to keep the promise he made to renegotiate the bad trade deals that had gutted millions of middle-class jobs.",31.82,30-35
100,What Do We Stand For,100_8,"Most of his advisors argued that the economy was so strong following our historic tax and regulatory cuts, that it didn't make sense to risk ""rocking the boat."" After the meeting, as I walked with my father back to the Residence, he said, ""You know, the reason this has never been done before is because our leaders haven't had the guts. When the economy is good, they settle for good, and when things are bad, they don't have the will or ability, so they kick the can until it's someone else's problem."" He was right. If my father didn't take on these fights, no one would.",36.36,35-40
100,What Do We Stand For,100_9,"In the months that followed, President Trump refused to settle for a good deal, he wanted a great deal — and ultimately, that's exactly what we got. I remember each time he was updated on the progress of the new trade deal with Mexico and Canada, he would say ""Don't let down those dairy farmers I met in Wisconsin. … I don't want them to like this deal, I want them to love it!"" Today, in the midst of an unprecedented global pandemic, it's more clear than ever that our president was absolutely correct to take on trade when he did — and bring our jobs, factories, and life-saving medicines back to the USA. As our nation endures this grave trial, I pray for the families who are mourning the loss of a loved one, for all those who are battling COVID-19, and for the first responders and healthcare heroes who remain on the frontlines of this fight.",40.91,40-45

I've been with my father and seen the pain in his eyes when he receives updates on the lives that have been stolen by this plague. I have witnessed him make some of the most difficult decisions of his life. I sat with him in the Oval Office as he stopped travel to Europe. I watched him take the strongest, most inclusive economy in our lifetime; the lowest unemployment in half a century, and the highest wage increase for working families in decades — and close it down to save American lives.",45.45,45-50

My father isn't deterred by defeatist thinkers. The word ""impossible"" — it only motivates him. Donald Trump rejects the cynical notion that our greatest achievements are behind us — he believes that nothing is beyond our reach, and the best is yet to come.

I was with my father when he decided to commute Alice's life sentence. Together, we watched Alice leave prison after nearly 22 years. As she ran into the arms of her family, and they celebrated a joyful reunion, my father was very quiet – I could see the emotion on his face. After a long silence, he looked at me and said: ""Imagine how many people there are just like Alice.""",54.55,50-55

As part of Republican tax cuts, in 2019 alone, our child tax credit put over $2,000 dollars into the pockets of 40 million American families. Democrat politicians recently introduced a plan to increase the child tax credit, yet when I was fighting less than three years ago, at the president's direction, to get Congress to double the child tax credit, not a single Democrat voted to pass the law — we got it done anyway! Four years ago, I promised that President Trump would support mothers in the workforce. In his first year in office, he signed into law the first-ever National Paid Leave Tax Credit.",68.18,65-70

Four years ago, I told you I would fight alongside my father, and, four years later, here I am.

100,What Do We Stand For,100_17,"Where politicians choose party, our president chooses people. Since the day he took the oath of office, I've watched my father take on the failed policies of the past and do what no other leader has done before. Recently, he took dramatic action to cut the cost of prescription drugs despite fielding angry calls from the CEOs of every major pharmaceutical company. Now, when we see an attack ad paid for by Big Pharma, my dad smiles and says to me, ""You know we're doing something right when they're hitting us so hard.""

To protect the most vulnerable among us, I've worked alongside the president as he signed into law nine pieces of legislation to combat the evil of human trafficking. I've stood by my father's side at Dover Air Force Base as he has received our fallen heroes, and each time it steeled his resolve to finally stop the endless foreign wars.

Defying all expectations, just weeks ago, he re-wrote history by making a peace agreement in the Middle East — the biggest breakthrough in a quarter century. For the first time in a long time, we have a president who has called out Washington's hypocrisy and they hate him for it.

101,Road Safety,101_0,"I congratulate our Chief Secretary, our Secretary Transport, our Director Transport, our DGP and all other colleagues for successfully organizing a whole very intensive Road Safety Week. Let's all clap and thank them. In my view, road safety or road usage reflects the character, it reflects the character of that place. Two things reflect the character of a place. One is the road surface, second is the road user.",0.0,0-5
101,Road Safety,101_1,Let me come to the road surface. The governance and administration is the better will the road be. Why? Because the road construction would be of higher quality. We spend a lot of money on the road construction but what actually is spent on the road construction is reflected or goes into the road construction is reflected on the quality of the road.,2.63,0-5
101,Road Safety,101_2,"And if you go from state to state, place to place, the road quality of the road varies. It varies. You see the highway, you see the state highway, you see the road here and you see a village road. The element of integrity is reflected in the road and there's a lot of road safety attached to it. If the quality of the road engineering is good, there will be better road safety.",5.26,5-10
101,Road Safety,101_3,"But if the quality of the road is bad, it will impact on the road safety. So therefore, roads are reflective of the quality of the administration of a place. When you go to the Western countries, you see very good clean safe road. How many of you have seen that? How many of you have seen clean roads, broad roads, thick roads in the West?",7.89,5-10
101,Road Safety,101_4,How many of you have seen it? Raise your hands. How many have seen it? Thank you. It reflects the seriousness in which they spend on the road and also the way the public works department or the road engineering spends on it.,10.53,10-15
101,Road Safety,101_5,"They do not compromise on it. They don't make money out of the road. Here, the biggest money-making is coming out of road construction and that is why road safety is compromised. Road safety, road construction is a very big source of revenue to people who would like to use the fund or let's say abuse the fund. Whereas it is so well used correctly for road safety in places where they want to.",13.16,10-15
101,Road Safety,101_6,"You see a good highway, it means all that money has gone into that road. So road safety and road construction is interlinked. Road engineering, called the three E's. Three E's of road safety, first of all is engineering. If the engineering is good, there's road safety.",15.79,15-20
101,Road Safety,101_7,"But if the engineering is defective, you see sudden breaks. So therefore, if you have to observe, if you have to achieve road safety, engineering, road engineering is very very vital. The second E, along with it, like for instance if you're going straight to the road and there are cuts in the road all the time, the cuts. You have a road and there's a cut. You have a road, there's a cut.",18.42,15-20
101,Road Safety,101_8,"But if there is no cut and you go on and there's a very good engineering roundabout to come back, it reduces accidents. Whereas if you have a road and there are cuts and there are cuts and cuts and you suddenly in between come, you will have a lot of fatal accidents. So road engineering, road safety is not only dependent on the police regulation. It is a lot dependent on road engineering, for which we don't have engineers sitting here. You only have law enforcers here, managers here, but not engineers here.",21.05,20-25
101,Road Safety,101_9,"So road engineering has to be a very vital part of road safety. It's like a double carriageway. When you drive and if you have two roads coming and if there is a central verge, you prevent accidents. But if you have no central verge, only one road going, one road, no central verge, the beams of the lights coming from the other side and my beams going on the other side has a blinding effect. You have lots of road accidents.",23.68,20-25
101,Road Safety,101_10,"Am I right? Am I right? So main point here is, even if you are a safe person, your road engineering is defective. It will lead to road accidents. So therefore, of no fault of the driver sometimes, you have real safety issues because of engineering.",26.32,25-30
101,Road Safety,101_11,"And I don't think… the point here is we've never worked together as road engineers, road educator and road enforcer. So the second thing is education. The second E of road safety is education. First is engineering. E for engineering, E for, what did I say?",28.95,25-30
101,Road Safety,101_12,"Education. Education is very occasionally a part of road safety. But if it is an intensive part of road, our growth in our schools, in our colleges, then road education. What is education? But if you don't have a zebra crossing, where do you cross from?",31.58,30-35
101,Road Safety,101_13,"You get your driving license very weakly, where is the road education about? So licensing policy and road education again go hand in hand. How serious this is. In the West, it is impossible almost to get a driving license. Here, it is so easily available that we can get a quickly a license and sometimes we can have more than one license.",34.21,30-35
101,Road Safety,101_14,"So our licensing policy and road safety is so interlinked in road safety. And the third E is enforcement. So three E's define road safety. One is engineering, second is education and the third is enforcement. In the enforcement, traffic police management, traffic management is restricted to only regulation.",36.84,35-40
101,Road Safety,101_15,"It's not on a tight enforcement. We must raise the fear of first of all regulation, second is enforcement. We must fine hugely in such a way that he does not do it again. But we are not afraid. I can pay 100 rupees all the time, 200 rupees all the time, but if I face, if I have fined 5000 rupees, 10,000 rupees, then I think twice before committing a violation.",39.47,35-40
101,Road Safety,101_16,"And therefore, our laws on enforcement are very lax and weak. They've been weak all the time. Earlier, you could not even find people on the spot. If I go back to my deputy commissioner police traffic days, many years ago, I remember we used to do a challan on paper for signal violation and I used to, my police constable used to give a challan to the person and that person used to tear it off. Say here's your challan, take it, take it.",42.11,40-45
101,Road Safety,101_17,"So I used to say 100 challans a day and we used to have 100 challans for motor vehicle act, whatever. Many of them used to tear it off and give it to the police constable. It made no difference because it had no effect. Paper challan had no effect. Then came the spot prosecution during that time that you can collect or there were mobile vans, mobile magistrate vans, you could find and get the spot.",44.74,40-45
101,Road Safety,101_18,"It started to have an effect, but the challan money was very low. It was very low. With the result, it still wasn't effective enough. Like for instance, drunken driving. Drunken driving offense is not as punitive as it should be because drunken driving means killing a man by negligence.",47.37,45-50
101,Road Safety,101_19,"It's not by intention, but negligence that you're drunk and you drive and you drive recklessly. So it's driving, killing a person by negligence and it's a rash or negligent act and it almost becomes billable at some time, soon enough. But the person is killed. Father is gone, but it is a death by negligence and the fine is not scary. That's why children died.",50.0,50-55
101,Road Safety,101_20,"The other day, day before yesterday in Hyderabad, SP traffic, DCP traffic has started. He arrested the parents of the minor children, minor driving the vehicle. Their parents were arrested day before yesterday. This was a radio news. Any minor who was driving the car, their parents were traced and they were arrested and sent to jail.",52.63,50-55
101,Road Safety,101_21,"Now that made news. That made news. Where the minor was sent to juvenile home, parents sent to jail. Isn't it? Has this happened in Pondicherry?",55.26,55-60
101,Road Safety,101_22,"Have you heard about it? I'm asking you, have you heard about it in Pondicherry? No. This is what we need to do. We need to do that.",57.89,55-60
101,Road Safety,101_23,"To me, this is enforcement. The third E. Enforce in such a way that they will not do it again. Not enforce in such a way that it's easy, okay, okay. Enforce in such a way that you say okay never again. So I would think the road safety campaign in Pondicherry should lead to a message that law, rule of law prevails in Pondicherry.",60.53,60-65
101,Road Safety,101_24,"You are caught, you will pay the heaviest fine. Heaviest fine so that you remember that you will never do it again. Pondicherry as a Union Territory has a very high rate of accidents. As our Chief Secretary was saying, helmet is still not a habit. It is an option.",63.16,60-65
101,Road Safety,101_25,"Whereas under the Motor Vehicle Act, it's mandatory. Under the rules it's mandatory. But it's still an option. And you have maximum accidents because of head injuries. So it's time that we say helmets have to be worn for your own safety.",65.79,65-70
101,Road Safety,101_26,"But it's also mandatory. Another serious thing which I've noticed is many vehicles are not insured. They don't have a third-party insurance. So when you kill somebody, there's no insurance. No insurance for the other person.",68.42,65-70
101,Road Safety,101_27,"So how is that person going to be compensated? Under the Motor Vehicle Act also. So friends, message for Road Pondicherry is that fine must be scared of. You must got to be afraid of being fined. And the fine should be heavy penalty.",71.05,70-75
101,Road Safety,101_28,"Confiscation of the vehicle, maybe arrest of the person. If there's a minor, trace the parent and arrest the parent. Because when the minor is driving and the minor is driving recklessly, then the vicarious liability and according to the law section 180, the parent is equally liable. And that's what Hyderabad police did. I would urge my law enforcer, particularly the Director General of Police and the all our SPs of traffic, inspectors of traffic, sub inspectors of traffic, that this Road Safety Week should take us towards heavy enforcement.",73.68,70-75
101,Road Safety,101_29,"We have made awareness for seven days. Seven days all about road safety. Road safety has been spoken about. If we have to lead it to an advantage or towards better road safety, then you must lead towards tighter enforcement. And enforcement is when you have found out not have insured vehicle or a minor is driving or there's drunken driving.",76.32,75-80
101,Road Safety,101_30,"At least these three should be very heavily fined. And the vehicle should be confiscated. It should be detained in the so that he understands that he has to be without a vehicle for some time. And including if we have to reduce fatal accidents for the benefit of the self, road helmet has to be made compulsory. When you going for a patrol for any reason, whether it's registration, you are served a helmet, you are buying a vehicle, you are getting a license, you have to have helmet if you don't have a helmet so that you get it straight away at that place.",78.95,75-80
101,Road Safety,101_31,"These I think are things for which Road Safety Weeks are meant to be celebrated. Engineering issues, education issues and enforcement issues. How do we build education? How do we improve our engineering? And how do we improve our enforcement?",81.58,80-85
101,Road Safety,101_32,"And since enforcement straight away, at the moment what is sitting before you is enforcement. Engineering, I don't see engineering sitting here as chief engineer whose public works department builds the roads for us or the municipal roads who make the municipal roads for us. They're very, very risky and they're not engineeringly cleared at all sometimes. It's not three E's working together. School principal, chief engineer and the traffic chief.",84.21,80-85
101,Road Safety,101_33,"They don't three sometimes work together. You need to work together. School principal, road engineer and the SP traffic. Three need to work together. Unless the three E's work together, there is no road safety.",86.84,85-90
101,Road Safety,101_34,"So I would take, I would hope that our, what hope? We'll make sure, why hope? We'll make sure that our officers down the line, the inspectors of traffic who are very active these days, our policemen who are on the job, our camera technology use, catching them by the number and then sending them the fine is further strengthened and reinforced in the coming days. It is already very well on ground but I think we can do even more from the enforcement point of view, particularly on the minors driving, triple riding, triple riding.",89.47,85-90
101,Road Safety,101_35,"Take the vehicle to the police station, call the parents of these triple riders, don't give the vehicle for the next two days you see the change. You have to be tough on enforcement. How many times will you keep requesting, requesting, requesting? Nobody gives you anything by request. Nobody pays a tax on request.",92.11,90-95
101,Road Safety,101_36,"Nobody cleans up the villages on request. Nobody does on request, don't work anymore. It has to be tight on enforcement, even if it hurts, even if it pinches you. Enforce, nobody voluntarily obeys the law, nobody voluntarily parks properly. It's not a habit.",94.74,90-95
101,Road Safety,101_37,"So therefore enforce the issue, the burden on enforcement has to be very, very high and our men and women who are on enforcement should be thoroughly educated on these laws of enforcement and things will be better.

102,The Harvard Spring,102_6,"I raised my hand to respond. ""Wait."" Professor Shapiro stopped me, ""Tell the president what to do"" and in walked the Ecuadorian president. In bringing the president to me, in having me speak to and question a shaper of history and experience the value he saw in my view, Harvard would make me feel I too could be him. I, too, had the power to shape history and not just be passively shaped by it.",60.0,60-65
102,The Harvard Spring,102_7,"That sense of infinite possibility we have as children – to think big and conquer great things – was returned to me here, a less despotic version of it. What seemed intractable problems of the world became opportunities for me, for us, to change things. You know, when I first got here my name was Sarah; after Harvard, it would become ""Hey Harvard!"" with people stuffing 378 years, 5,000 acres of real estate, the entirety of Widener library and 32 heads of state all into my 5 foot 6 inch self! Ridiculous as it is, there's a strange reality to it.",70.0,70-75
102,The Harvard Spring,102_8,"Arab-American author Randa Jarrar pictures inhabiting a new place as ""[…] running barefoot, the skin of our feet collecting sand and seeds and rocks and grass until we had shoes, shoes made of everything we'd picked up as we ran."" And running through Harvard Yard over the past four years, the skin of our feet collecting a world of experiences, we each become this place in a strange way, each of us picking up bits of people and history and ideas that changed the way we saw the world... accumulations I hope we will continue to wear on our ""soles"" and leave a footprint of all the best we took from Harvard Yard on our new destinations. And that's why I am hopeful for the future. I am hopeful because of my dining hall dinners spent marveling at friends who, while their countries wage bloody war against each other, are able to carry out civil conversation and build generative projects together. I am hopeful because of the Founding Mothers and Founding Fathers of revolutionary ideas like these being launched into the world who will make of its institutions, its constitutions, its hospitals, its art houses something better.",80.0,80-85
102,The Harvard Spring,102_9,"We've heard a lot in the news about an Arab Spring – this graduation is sending 6,000 revolutions into the world in the 6,000 revolutions graduating as part of the class of 2014 … if we take those waiting revolutions, those great ideas sparked behind Chipotle burritos and Starbucks coffee cups in our version of Tahrir Square, Harvard Square, out with us into the real world, into the real Tahrir Squares, and make something of them! Revolutions not in arms but in minds … more powerful and permanent and pervasive. For, this isn't a Ukrainian revolution or an Arab Spring, but a global revolution. This is the Harvard Spring of 2014. This is the Harvard Spring!",90.0,90-95
103,Bring a Smile,103_0,"Good afternoon everybody, ladies and gentlemen, and the Smile Train extended family. I congratulate Smile Train today for completing 500,000 cleft surgeries in India. In the context of what we're talking about, it is a short span of 18 years, and I consider myself extremely privileged to be sharing this, in celebrating this occasion because, in the honourable work that Smile Train does, this is truly and very endearingly referred to as a ""smilestone"". One that we collectively are extremely proud of. And one we feel blessed to be a part of.",0.0,0-5
103,Bring a Smile,103_1,"Smile Train and I have now been associated for almost a decade. And this journey has truly been wonderful. Thank you for having me on board, on this wonderful journey.

I've had the opportunity on various occasions with Smile Train to have interacted with the children.",7.69,5-10
103,Bring a Smile,103_2,"Post their surgeries, and we all talk about at our various meets about how the kids get a new lease of life and get to enjoy all the privileges that we all do on a day-to-day basis of this blessed life. And it's really, truly very, very fulfilling to experience that first-hand with the children. But all this would not have been possible without the dedication and the work of all you doctors. Thank you so much for partnering with Smile Train, all the nurses, the speech therapists, the orthodontists, the workers on the ground, on the job, thank you for your dedication and your continuous efforts to help the dreams of so many children and their families come true. And by providing cleft care to all these children, we are actually able to give them a wonderful life.",15.38,15-20

The outreach workers who travel from village to village to reach out to children with clefts, uniformed personnel of border security force and Sashastra Seema Bal and their Wives Association who connect children with Smile Train in border areas and difficult geographies. The government partners who work with Smile Train under the National Health Mission. You all make invaluable contributions in ensuring that every child has access to cleft treatment.",23.08,20-25
103,Bring a Smile,103_4,"It gives me joy to see the generosity of the corporate sector in India and all the individual donors. Thank you so much for keeping this journey ongoing. With everyone's support and dedication, I'm confident of many, many more ""smilestones"" to come. I have been fortunate to have also had the opportunity of sharing on this, my journey, my family's participation. My parents and my daughter also recently or be it very early in her life has gotten introduced to the work that we do together with Smile Train.",30.77,30-35
103,Bring a Smile,103_5,"And I'm so thankful, so grateful to God that I've been able to share in this experience and get them to recognize and get them to participate in such effective work with children. I'd say world over, but at this point, currently very, very strongly even here in India. Last year, Smile Train very, very generously offered to honour my father the late Mr. Krishna Raj Rai by announcing his birth date, the 20th of November as the day of Smiles. Thank you so much because this meant so much to us. My father worked with me, with Smile Train, and you know, you all who know me over the years, know that I like to always do something more effective and more concrete, on every personal occasion actually of our family.",38.46,35-40
103,Bring a Smile,103_6,"That's what my parents always taught me. So, these things don't get announced, but we've always done it. So, when the, my daughter's birthday is on the 16th of November and dad's is the 20th. So, the year before, in fact, was the first time, his last, that I celebrated Aaradhya and dad's birthday together. So, this year was particularly emotional for us as a family.",46.15,45-50
103,Bring a Smile,103_7,"And I really wanted to do something very, very effective. And with daddy, it had to be about smiles. It had to be about celebrating everything that he has taught me, everything that we have passed down through me to Aaradhya. It had to be about bringing a smile to people's lives. And we have worked together with Smile Train.",53.85,50-55
103,Bring a Smile,103_8,"So, thank you so much that we have together decided that the 20th of November will be the day of smiles. And we continue to bring smiles into so many children's lives, people's lives and their family's lives. Every day deserves to be as a day of smiles, in everybody's life. I always say it's in the now, it's in the present. You've got to thank God for this blessing called life every minute.",61.54,60-65
103,Bring a Smile,103_9,"And we have to make a difference every minute that we can. And hence, a day of smiles is every day. But yes, I guess I've chosen to underline it with the 20th of November. I'm proud to be associated with Smile Train for all these years. And I extend my heartfelt congratulations once again, to everyone present here and all those who are unable to be present here with us today for your effective work, for your dedicated work.",69.23,65-70
103,Bring a Smile,103_10,"Thank you so much for making a difference in so many children's lives and supporting the work of Smile Train through the Aishwarya Rai Foundation, has been my small personal contribution in the larger picture of the honourable and effective change in the lives of cleft patients. I look forward to continuing working with Smile Train for many, many more years to come. We refer to the number of years. We refer to the numbers in terms of the surgeries, these many ""smilestones"" to feel inspired, to feel motivated, to feel validated with all the work that everybody does on a daily basis. But these are merely numbers and there's no end to wanting to achieve that next ""smilestone"".",76.92,75-80
103,Bring a Smile,103_11,"So, the work we all agree will be ongoing for as long as, and as far as our journey can take us. So, I won't put a cap on the number of years.
